  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to fear-driven compliance with authority requests that bypass normal verification procedures",
    "context": "Fear-based compliance without verification occurs when employees bypass normal security checks when pressured by apparent authority figures, especially under time constraints or threat of consequences. This psychological vulnerability creates a pathway for attackers to impersonate executives, IT staff, or compliance officers to obtain unauthorized access, financial transfers, or sensitive information. Organizations with steep hierarchies, punitive cultures, or high-stress environments show increased susceptibility to these attacks.",
    "impact": "Organizations experiencing fear-based compliance vulnerabilities suffer significant losses from CEO fraud (average $50K-$50M), fake IT support attacks leading to system compromise and data breaches, regulatory impersonation attacks, and amplified damage during crisis periods. Historical incidents include Ubiquiti ($46.7M loss), FACC (€50M loss), and Target (2013 contractor credential compromise).",
    "psychological_basis": "When fear is activated, the amygdala triggers fight-flight responses before prefrontal cortex engagement occurs, creating a 300-500ms window where automatic compliance mechanisms override rational verification processes. The stress response floods the system with cortisol and adrenaline, impairing working memory and executive function—precisely the cognitive resources needed for verification behaviors. Drawing from Milgram's obedience studies and LeDoux's fear conditioning research, fear amplifies authority compliance by systematically disabling normal verification checks."
