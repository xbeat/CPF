    "short": "Measures organizational vulnerability to authority-based security bypasses, where employees violate security protocols when requested by superiors or those claiming authority",
    "context": "This indicator measures organizational vulnerability to authority-based security bypasses, where employees violate security protocols when requested by superiors or those claiming authority. The psychological mechanism exploits hierarchical obedience patterns, where immediate authority compliance overrides security reasoning. This creates critical cybersecurity exposure through CEO fraud, executive impersonation attacks, and authority-based social engineering that can bypass technical controls entirely.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high vulnerability experience successful business email compromise, fraudulent wire transfers, and unauthorized access through social engineering. Historical incidents include the Ubiquiti Networks $46.7M fraud, Twitter Bitcoin Scam internal access compromise, Target breach via HVAC vendor credential bypass, and Anthem breach through help desk social engineering. The psychological mechanism operates through authority gradient effects where proximity to power reduces critical thinking, cognitive load redistribution that defaults to pleasing authority figures, and social identity preservation that prioritizes hierarchical position over abstract security concerns.",
    "psychological_basis": "This vulnerability stems from the fundamental conflict between hierarchical obedience and security protocols, rooted in Milgram's seminal research on authority compliance (65% compliance rate with perceived authority). The psychological mechanism operates through Authority Gradient Theory where hierarchical power differential creates an authority gradient that reduces critical thinking, Cognitive Load Redistribution where dual demands cause individuals to default to the path of least psychological resistance, and Social Identity Preservation where employees unconsciously prioritize maintaining organizational hierarchy position over abstract security concerns. Neurologically, authority perception activates anterior cingulate cortex while reducing prefrontal cortex activity, diminishing critical thinking and risk assessment capabilities."
