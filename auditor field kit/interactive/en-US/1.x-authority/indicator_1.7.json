  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who leverage technical expertise claims to bypass security controls",
    "context": "When employees encounter complex technical problems beyond their knowledge, they often bypass normal security protocols and defer to anyone who sounds technically competent. Attackers exploit this by impersonating IT support, vendors, or technical consultants to gain system access, credentials, or sensitive information.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience successful social engineering through fake IT support, malicious software installation, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration. Historical incidents include Kevin Mitnick's extensive use of technical impersonation, RSA SecurID breach (2011), Target breach (2013), and Anthem breach (2015) where technical authority claims facilitated initial compromise and credential theft.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cognitive offloading - when individuals encounter technical complexity exceeding their expertise, they automatically transfer decision-making authority to perceived experts, bypassing normal verification protocols. This mechanism operates through epistemic dependence (reliance on others for specialized knowledge) combined with Dunning-Kruger effects where limited technical knowledge prevents evaluation of technical claims. Cognitive Load Theory explains why technical jargon overwhelms processing capacity, forcing reliance on source credibility rather than content evaluation."
