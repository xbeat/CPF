    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who impersonate executives, IT support, or other authority figures to bypass security controls",
    "context": "When employees receive requests from apparent authority figures, they often comply automatically without verification, creating a pre-cognitive vulnerability that attackers exploit through CEO fraud, fake IT support calls, and executive impersonation emails.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience successful business email compromise, fraudulent wire transfers, and unauthorized access through social engineering. Historical incidents include the $46.7 million Ubiquiti Networks fraud and numerous BEC incidents.",
    "psychological_basis": "Milgram's obedience studies (1974) - 65% compliance with perceived authority. Neurologically, authority perception activates anterior cingulate cortex and reduces prefrontal cortex activity, diminishing critical thinking and risk assessment."
