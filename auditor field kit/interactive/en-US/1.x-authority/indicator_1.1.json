    "short": "Measures automatic compliance with perceived authority figures without verification, creating systematic vulnerabilities when requests appear to come from executives, IT staff, or other trusted sources",
    "context": "Employees automatically follow requests from perceived authority figures without verification, bypassing normal security protocols when commands appear to come from executives, IT staff, or other trusted sources. This psychological vulnerability enables attackers to impersonate authority figures and manipulate staff into compromising security controls, transferring funds, or sharing sensitive information. Organizations with rigid hierarchies or high-stress environments amplify this risk significantly.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high unquestioning compliance experience successful business email compromise attacks, fraudulent wire transfers averaging $46.7M per incident, and systematic security control bypasses. The FBI reports $43 billion in BEC losses between 2016-2021, with authority-based compliance as the primary exploitation mechanism. Technical security controls are rendered ineffective when users willingly disable them upon authority request.",
    "psychological_basis": "Unquestioning compliance operates through deeply ingrained evolutionary and social conditioning. Milgram's obedience studies (1974) demonstrated 65% compliance with perceived authority even when causing apparent harm. Neurologically, authority perception activates the anterior cingulate cortex 300-500ms before prefrontal cortex engagement, meaning compliance responses occur before conscious security evaluation. This automatic deference served evolutionary survival purposes within hierarchical groups but creates exploitable vulnerabilities in cybersecurity contexts where authority claims may be fabricated."
