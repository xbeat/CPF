  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to security accountability gaps when individuals assume someone else in the organizational hierarchy is handling oversight, creating dangerous blind spots where critical decisions fall between management levels",
    "context": "Diffusion of responsibility occurs when individuals assume someone else in their organization is handling security oversight, creating dangerous gaps where critical decisions fall between management levels. This psychological pattern leads to delayed incident response, unpatched vulnerabilities, and successful social engineering attacks because no one takes personal accountability for security actions. Organizations with complex hierarchies are particularly vulnerable as employees defer security decisions upward while management assumes operational teams are monitoring threats.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high diffusion experience security monitoring gaps, delayed incident response, unpatched vulnerabilities, and successful social engineering through hierarchical seams. Historical incidents include Target Corporation (2013) breach where responsibility diffusion between IT and security teams created monitoring blind spots, Equifax (2017) where critical patches fell between infrastructure, security, and business units, and SolarWinds (2020) where diffusion between development, security, and customer organizations enabled supply chain compromise.",
    "psychological_basis": "Milgram's authority studies (1974) demonstrated that hierarchical structures fundamentally alter individual moral reasoning and personal responsibility, with participants showing decreased accountability when acting within command structures. Latané & Darley's bystander effect research (1970) established that responsibility diffusion increases with the number of potential actors - in organizational contexts, this translates to security responsibility being diluted across hierarchical levels. Neurologically, fMRI studies (Beyer et al., 2015) show that hierarchical contexts reduce anterior cingulate cortex activation, the brain region responsible for personal agency and conflict monitoring, literally altering how individuals process personal responsibility."
