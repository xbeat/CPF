  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to organizational hierarchy creating psychological barriers that prevent essential security information from flowing upward through organizational structures",
    "context": "Authority gradient creates psychological barriers that prevent employees from reporting security incidents, vulnerabilities, or suspicious activities when those issues involve or might implicate senior leadership or executive-endorsed systems. This vulnerability systematically blocks critical security information from reaching those who can act on it, creating blind spots that attackers actively exploit through executive impersonation, CEO fraud, and targeting of authority-protected systems.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high authority gradients experience delayed incident reporting, systematic underreporting of executive-related security issues, and successful CEO fraud attacks. Employees experience unconscious anxiety about challenging authority figures, creating conditions where security reporting becomes psychologically threatening regardless of formal policies. Historical incidents show that security indicators are frequently observed by multiple employees but not reported due to perceived involvement of authority figures.",
    "psychological_basis": "Milgram's obedience studies (1974) demonstrated that ordinary individuals consistently defer to authority figures even when such deference contradicts their own moral judgment. Combined with Edmondson's psychological safety research, which reveals that team members' willingness to report errors directly correlates with their perception of interpersonal risk, high authority gradients systematically reduce psychological safety. Neurological research shows exposure to authority figures activates threat response pathways before conscious decision-making occurs, explaining why logical security policies fail to overcome authority gradient effects."
