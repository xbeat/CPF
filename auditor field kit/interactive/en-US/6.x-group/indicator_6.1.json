  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to collective suppression of dissenting security opinions leading to systematic blind spots where groups prioritize harmony over critical thinking",
    "context": "Groupthink occurs when security teams prioritize harmony and consensus over critical thinking and realistic threat assessment. This creates dangerous blind spots where teams collectively dismiss valid security concerns, suppress dissenting views, and maintain false confidence in inadequate security measures. Organizations with groupthink patterns become predictably vulnerable to attackers who exploit these shared assumptions and consensus-driven decision making.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high groupthink vulnerability experience failure to detect threats that don't fit consensus assumptions, systematic dismissal of external security findings, suppression of internal security concerns, and rapid consensus around inadequate security measures. Historical incidents include Target Corporation (2013), Equifax (2017), SolarWinds (2020), and Colonial Pipeline (2021).",
    "psychological_basis": "Irving Janis (1972) groupthink research identifying illusion of invulnerability, collective rationalization, and pressure on dissenters. Bion's Basic Assumptions (1961) shows groups unconsciously adopt dependency states that interfere with realistic task performance. Social Identity Theory demonstrates in-group favoritism creates blind spots where organizations overestimate their security sophistication while underestimating threats."
