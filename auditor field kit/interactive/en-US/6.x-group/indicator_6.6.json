  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability created when organizations unconsciously seek 'silver bullet' security solutions and over-rely on specific vendors, tools, or personnel for protection, creating dangerous single points of failure",
    "context": "Organizations experiencing dependency group assumptions unconsciously seek omnipotent security solutions and transfer responsibility to external protective figures. This creates dangerous single points of failure where attackers can exploit the organization's blind trust in their chosen protective figures. When security responsibility is psychologically transferred to external entities, internal vigilance and critical thinking deteriorate, making organizations vulnerable to vendor impersonation attacks, fraudulent security solutions, and supply chain compromises.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high dependency scores experience vendor impersonation attacks exploiting trusted relationships, supply chain compromises through idealized security partners, and critical failures when single-point dependencies fail. Historical incidents include the SolarWinds attack leveraging extreme vendor trust and Equifax breach demonstrating over-reliance on external security assurances while failing internal vigilance.",
    "psychological_basis": "Bion's Group Dynamics Theory (1961) identifies dependency (baD) as one of three unconscious basic assumptions groups adopt when work group functioning is threatened by anxiety. Groups regress to infantile psychological states where they collectively abandon adult responsibility, instead seeking an idealized parent figure who will handle all threats. This creates profound vulnerability because the group's security posture becomes entirely dependent on the perceived strength of the protective figure while losing capacity for independent threat assessment."
