  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to accountability gaps where critical security tasks fall through organizational cracks because everyone assumes others are responsible",
    "context": "Diffusion of responsibility occurs when individual accountability decreases as group size increases, leading to the 'someone else will handle it' mindset. In cybersecurity, this creates dangerous gaps where critical security tasks fall through organizational cracks because everyone assumes others are responsible. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous during incident response, policy enforcement, and routine security monitoring where delayed or missed actions can lead to significant breaches.",
    "impact": "Organizations with diffused security responsibilities experience delayed incident response, security tasks falling through cracks, and post-incident analysis revealing 'everyone thought someone else was responsible.' Historical incidents include the Equifax breach where multiple teams assumed others were monitoring critical vulnerabilities, and the Target breach where security alerts were ignored by multiple teams.",
    "psychological_basis": "Darley & Latané's (1968) bystander intervention experiments demonstrating inverse relationship between group size and individual action probability. The core cognitive distortion involves the belief that 'someone else will handle it' or 'it's not specifically my job.' Neuroimaging studies show reduced activation in anterior cingulate cortex (responsible for personal accountability) and increased activation in temporoparietal junction (associated with social cognition) during group decision-making."
