    "short": "Measures tendency for groups to make riskier security decisions than individuals would make alone, driven by diffused responsibility and social pressure to appear bold",
    "context": "Risky shift phenomena occurs when groups consistently make riskier decisions than individuals would make alone, driven by diffused responsibility and social pressure to appear bold or innovative. In cybersecurity contexts, this creates vulnerability when security committees, incident response teams, or cross-functional groups systematically underestimate risks or approve dangerous shortcuts that individual team members would reject. Organizations with heavy committee-based decision making show measurably higher rates of security incidents stemming from overly aggressive risk acceptance.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high risky shift vulnerability experience security incidents from overly aggressive group decisions, implementation failures from underestimated risks, emergency bypasses that become permanent vulnerabilities, and vendor/technology selections with inadequate security controls. Groups approve risky shortcuts individuals would reject.",
    "psychological_basis": "Stoner (1961) original discovery showing groups consistently chose riskier decisions than individuals. Myers & Lamm (1976) meta-analysis confirming effect across 316 studies with average effect size d=0.7. fMRI studies show reduced anterior cingulate cortex (risk monitoring) activation during group decisions with increased ventral striatum (reward seeking) activation when group members express risk tolerance."
