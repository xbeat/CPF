    "short": "Measures vulnerability created when organizations unconsciously coordinate psychological defenses to avoid anxiety about cybersecurity threats, creating systematic blind spots that persist despite technical controls",
    "context": "Collective defense mechanisms occur when organizations unconsciously coordinate psychological defenses to avoid anxiety about cybersecurity threats, creating systematic blind spots that persist despite technical controls. These manifest as shared organizational assumptions like 'we're different from other breach victims,' automatic consensus in security discussions, and collective resistance to acknowledging internal vulnerabilities. This creates exploitable gaps where attackers leverage predictable organizational blind spots, trusted insider assumptions, and systematic avoidance of uncomfortable security truths.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high collective defense vulnerability experience advanced persistent threats exploiting consistent organizational blind spots, insider threat amplification through 'sacred cow' individuals or systems immune from suspicion, social engineering via group psychology manipulation, and regulatory compliance theater focusing on external requirements while ignoring internal vulnerabilities. Historical incidents include Target Data Breach (2013) with collective denial about POS system vulnerabilities, Equifax Breach (2017) with collective responsibility diffusion, and SolarWinds attack (2020) with industry-wide collective trust in trusted suppliers.",
    "psychological_basis": "Bion (1961) identified basic assumption groups - collective unconscious states that organizations adopt when faced with anxiety. Klein (1946) demonstrated how splitting prevents realistic threat assessment. Menzies Lyth (1960) showed how institutions develop anxiety-reducing structures that paradoxically increase vulnerability. Modern neuroscience (mirror neuron research) demonstrates how defensive emotions spread unconsciously through organizational networks, with group membership affecting individual threat perception and risk assessment."
