    "short": "Measures vulnerability to delayed incident response when multiple potential responders assume 'someone else' will handle the cybersecurity threat",
    "context": "The bystander effect in incident response occurs when multiple potential responders are available, but each assumes 'someone else' will handle the cybersecurity threat, creating dangerous delays. This psychological phenomenon exploits diffusion of responsibility - the more people who could act, the less likely any individual will take action. Organizations with larger security teams, matrix management structures, or distributed security responsibilities are particularly vulnerable to attacks that rely on delayed response times.",
    "impact": "Organizations vulnerable to bystander effects experience delayed incident containment, critical security events going unreported due to assumption others have escalated, and reduced response times when more people are available to respond. The 2013 Target breach exemplifies this with multiple security team members receiving alerts but each assuming others were investigating, resulting in 17-day delay. Organizations show significant delays between alert detection and human response initiation during business hours when more personnel are available.",
    "psychological_basis": "Darley and Latané's (1968) landmark experiments demonstrating individuals are less likely to help in emergencies when others are present. Three primary pathways: diffusion of responsibility (individual accountability decreases as group size increases), audience inhibition (fear of public failure prevents action), and social influence (looking to others for response cues leading to collective inaction). Neuroscience research shows bystander situations activate different neural pathways with reduced anterior cingulate cortex activation (personal responsibility) and increased superior temporal sulcus activation (social cognition)."
