    "short": "Measures vulnerability created when organizations unconsciously believe that combining two specific security elements will miraculously solve fundamental security problems without difficult organizational changes",
    "context": "Pairing hope fantasies occur when organizations unconsciously believe that combining two specific security elements—technologies, vendors, or methodologies—will miraculously solve fundamental security problems without difficult organizational changes. This psychological pattern diverts resources from addressing current vulnerabilities while teams wait for 'perfect combinations' that may never materialize. Organizations exhibiting this pattern become vulnerable to attacks that exploit unaddressed current weaknesses and the security gaps created during extended integration planning phases.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high pairing hope fantasy vulnerability experience delayed incident response while waiting for integrated solutions, security gaps created during lengthy integration projects, over-privileged vendor access granted to facilitate hoped-for integrations, and underfunded present security due to budget allocation toward future pairing solutions. This creates exploitable windows where attackers leverage unaddressed current vulnerabilities while organizations focus resources on future promised capabilities.",
    "psychological_basis": "Bion's Basic Assumption Pairing (baP) - groups unconsciously develop belief that salvation will come from pairing or coupling of two members, ideas, or solutions that will produce miraculous future solution to current problems. Klein's Object Relations Theory (1946) explains how organizations split security solutions into 'all good' (hoped-for pairing) and 'all bad' (current inadequate solutions). Neuroscientific research shows brain's dopamine pathways activate more strongly for anticipated rewards than actual rewards, explaining neurobiological basis for fixation on future security solutions."
