    "short": "Measures the tendency for individuals to reduce security effort when working in groups, assuming others will handle critical security functions",
    "context": "Social loafing occurs when individuals reduce their security effort when working in groups, assuming others will handle critical security functions. This creates dangerous accountability gaps where everyone thinks 'someone else is watching' - leading to undetected threats, delayed incident response, and collective security negligence. Organizations with team-based security responsibilities without individual accountability show 23% longer breach durations and significantly higher regulatory compliance failures.",
    "impact": "Organizations vulnerable to social loafing experience reduced investigation depth when security incidents assigned to teams rather than individuals, documentation quality decreases when security compliance is team-based responsibility, and average 23% increase in breach duration when security responsibilities are team-based. Social engineering success rates increase 300% when targeting teams vs. individuals.",
    "psychological_basis": "Ringelmann (1913) and Latané et al. (1979) identified social loafing as the tendency to exert less effort in groups compared to individual work. Three primary mechanisms: diffusion of responsibility (individual accountability diluted in teams), social facilitation reversal (complex security tasks suffer in group settings), and motivational loss (individual contributions less identifiable). fMRI studies show reduced anterior cingulate cortex activation (effort monitoring) in group contexts."
