    "short": "Measures vulnerability created when organizations unconsciously adopt either aggressive defensive stances (fight) or complete avoidance behaviors (flight) when facing cybersecurity threats",
    "context": "Fight-flight security postures occur when organizations unconsciously adopt either aggressive defensive stances (fight) or complete avoidance behaviors (flight) when facing cybersecurity threats. This creates systematic blind spots where organizations either over-invest in perimeter defenses while ignoring internal threats, or avoid security decisions entirely through denial and delegation. These reactive patterns bypass rational risk assessment and create predictable vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high fight-flight vulnerability experience insider threat blindness from over-focus on external perimeters, alert fatigue amplification from aggressive monitoring creating noise that obscures genuine threats, or security avoidance leading to delayed threat investigation. Historical incidents include organizations implementing aggressive DLP solutions that block legitimate business while missing subtle data exfiltration, and executive teams avoiding security briefings until after breaches occur.",
    "psychological_basis": "Bion's Basic Assumption Fight-Flight (baF) - a pre-conscious group dynamic where organizations unconsciously adopt binary defensive stances when facing threats. This psychological mechanism operates below rational decision-making threshold, typically activating within 300-500ms of threat perception. LeDoux (2000) demonstrates that amygdala activation (threat response) occurs before prefrontal cortex engagement (rational analysis), explaining why organizations default to fight-flight postures before implementing structured security frameworks."
