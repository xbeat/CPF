    "short": "Measures vulnerability created when organizations unconsciously divide security threats into oversimplified 'trusted internal' versus 'dangerous external' categories",
    "context": "Organizational splitting occurs when organizations unconsciously divide security threats into oversimplified 'trusted internal' versus 'dangerous external' categories. This binary thinking creates dangerous blind spots by over-trusting insiders and systems while projecting all risk onto external attackers. Organizations experiencing splitting exhibit extreme trust in certain actors (long-term employees, vendors, executives) while attributing security failures exclusively to sophisticated external threats, making them vulnerable to insider attacks and social engineering.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high splitting vulnerability experience trusted insider data theft exploiting idealized status, social engineering attacks leveraging trust transfer mechanisms, supply chain infiltration through inadequate vendor scrutiny, and lateral movement exploitation through implicit trust assumptions. Historical incidents include Edward Snowden case where extreme trust in cleared personnel enabled massive data exfiltration, Target breach where trust in HVAC vendor credentials enabled network infiltration, and SolarWinds attack exploiting organizational trust in software update processes.",
    "psychological_basis": "Klein's Object Relations Theory (1946) identifies splitting as primitive defense mechanism where ego cannot tolerate ambivalence about objects that are both good and bad. In organizational contexts, this translates to inability to hold anxiety-provoking reality that trusted insiders can pose security risks. Bion (1961) demonstrated how groups under anxiety adopt basic assumptions that distort reality. Modern neuroscience supports Klein's observations with amygdala activation creating rapid categorization of stimuli as threatening or safe, with stress increasing brain's tendency toward binary categorization."
