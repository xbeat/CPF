  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to unconscious equation of security symbols with reality, causing users to trust visual indicators rather than underlying security states",
    "context": "In the unconscious mind under stress or cognitive load, symbols become indistinguishable from what they represent. Users treat security icons (padlocks, certificates, antivirus badges) as magical talismans providing actual protection rather than representations requiring verification. This symbolic equation thinking bypasses rational security analysis, making users vulnerable to any attack that mimics familiar security symbols.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high symbolic equation confusion experience successful scareware campaigns, certificate spoofing attacks, and brand impersonation. Users make critical security decisions based on visual appearance of alerts and icons without verifying underlying reality, resulting in malware infections despite 'security awareness.'",
    "psychological_basis": "Klein's (1930) symbolic equation theory demonstrates that under anxiety, symbols and reality become fused in unconscious processing. Libet's (1983) experiments show decision-making occurs 300-500ms before conscious awareness, with symbolic processing dominating. When cognitive load exceeds capacity, individuals resort to symbolic shortcuts (Miller, 1956)."
