  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to unconscious archetypal patterns that bypass security protocols when triggered by symbolic messaging",
    "context": "Archetypes are universal psychological patterns inherited in the collective unconscious that automatically evoke powerful emotional and behavioral responses. When attackers use archetypal themes—'be the hero,' 'urgent authority request,' 'clever workaround'—they trigger pre-cognitive responses that override rational security thinking. Digital environments, being transitional spaces between reality and imagination, create ideal conditions for archetypal projection and activation.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high archetypal vulnerability experience successful social engineering attacks exploiting emotional themes rather than technical weaknesses. Employees bypass security procedures during 'emergencies' (hero archetype), comply without verification to 'authority figures' (parent archetype), or celebrate 'clever' security violations (trickster archetype). Otherwise security-conscious employees act impulsively when archetypal patterns activate.",
    "psychological_basis": "Jung's (1969) analytical psychology demonstrates archetypes as universal patterns bypassing ego defenses. fMRI studies show limbic system activation (emotion/instinct) preceding prefrontal cortex (rational analysis) by 300-500ms (LeDoux, 2000). System 1 processing dominates archetypal responses, creating compelling urges to act before conscious security awareness intervenes (Kahneman, 2011)."
