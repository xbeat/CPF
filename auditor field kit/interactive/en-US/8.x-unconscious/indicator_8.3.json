  "description": {
    "short": "Measures the degree to which organizations unconsciously recreate the same security failures, attack scenarios, or crisis patterns despite conscious awareness that these patterns cause harm",
    "context": "Repetition compulsion represents an unconscious psychological drive to repeat familiar vulnerability patterns even when alternative, safer behaviors are known and available. This goes beyond simple habit formation or procedural errors—organizations unconsciously seek familiar patterns of vulnerability because they feel psychologically safer than unknown security states. Sophisticated attackers identify and exploit these predictable repetition cycles.",
    "impact": "Organizations exhibiting repetition compulsion experience clustering of similar security incidents across time, particularly around anniversary dates of past failures. This creates predictable vulnerability windows that advanced persistent threats systematically exploit through temporal pattern recognition and attack timing strategies. Despite conscious intentions to improve, organizations unconsciously recreate the same incident response failures, vendor selection mistakes, and resource allocation patterns.",
    "psychological_basis": "Freud's 'Beyond the Pleasure Principle' (1920) established repetition compulsion as fundamental to human psychology, where individuals unconsciously recreate traumatic situations in attempts to master them. Klein's object relations theory (1946) demonstrates how early relational patterns repeat in organizational contexts. Jung's concept of complexes (1969) explains how unconscious psychological structures perpetuate repetitive behavior patterns. Neuroscience research on neural pathway reinforcement shows that repeated patterns create stronger synaptic connections, making familiar behaviors easier to activate than novel alternatives."
