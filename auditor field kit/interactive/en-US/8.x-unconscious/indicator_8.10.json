  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to fantasy-based thinking in digital environments where users suspend critical evaluation and make security decisions based on emotional responses rather than reality testing",
    "context": "Digital environments function as transitional spaces—neither fully real nor fully imaginary—activating unconscious psychological processes that mirror dream states. Users apply dream-like cognitive processes (primary process thinking) where logical causality suspends, symbolic thinking dominates, and reality constraints relax. This manifests as immediate acceptance of impossible digital scenarios, anthropomorphization of AI systems, and security decisions based on 'how things feel' rather than analytical threat assessment.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high dream logic vulnerability experience successful deepfake attacks, AI chatbot manipulation, and metaverse social engineering. Employees immediately trust unusual digital requests without verification, anthropomorphize automated systems sharing sensitive information, and blur boundaries between gaming/entertainment contexts and serious business operations. Users bypass authentication because digital requests 'seemed urgent' or 'felt legitimate' based on emotional response rather than verification.",
    "psychological_basis": "Winnicott's (1971) transitional space theory shows digital environments suspend normal reality testing. fMRI studies reveal virtual environments activate similar brain regions to REM sleep—reduced prefrontal cortex (reality testing) and increased limbic activity (emotional processing). Freud's (1900) primary process thinking manifests as condensation (merging identities), displacement (transferring trust), and symbolic thinking over analytical reasoning."
