  "description": {
    "short": "Measures organization-wide unconscious behavioral patterns that create predictable cybersecurity vulnerabilities during stress, transitions, or cultural events",
    "context": "Organizations develop shared unconscious patterns—collective psychological structures that influence security-related behaviors across entire employee populations. These patterns manifest during organizational stress, transitions, or cultural events when employees collectively abandon security protocols in favor of 'heroic' responses or group-think decisions. Unlike individual vulnerabilities, collective patterns emerge from the shared organizational psyche and create synchronized vulnerabilities that attackers can time and exploit systematically.",
    "impact": "Organizations with strong collective unconscious patterns experience clustered security incidents around predictable dates (holidays, fiscal periods, company events), synchronized protocol abandonment during stress, and group-based security decision failures. Attackers increasingly time campaigns during vulnerable collective periods and frame social engineering using culturally resonant themes, achieving significantly higher success rates than random timing.",
    "psychological_basis": "Jung's (1969) collective unconscious theory describes inherited psychological structures shared across groups. Bion's (1961) research on group dynamics demonstrates how organizations unconsciously adopt shared defensive postures. Neuroscience research shows group decision-making activates different neural networks than individual decisions, supporting existence of collective psychological processes distinct from individual psychology."
