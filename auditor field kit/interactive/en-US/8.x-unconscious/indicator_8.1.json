  "description": {
    "short": "Measures the degree to which organizations unconsciously project their disowned aggressive, destructive, or threatening aspects onto external cybersecurity threats while idealizing internal employees and trusted partners",
    "context": "Shadow projection occurs when organizations unconsciously focus all security concerns on external 'bad actors' while idealizing internal employees and trusted partners as inherently safe. This psychological blind spot leads to systematic underinvestment in insider threat detection and creates vulnerabilities that sophisticated attackers routinely exploit.",
    "impact": "Organizations exhibiting strong shadow projection spend heavily on perimeter defenses while remaining vulnerable to social engineering, insider threats, and supply chain compromises. Historical incidents include the Aldrich Ames CIA case, Edward Snowden revelations, and numerous corporate data breaches involving exploitation of insider access.",
    "psychological_basis": "Jung (1969) identified the shadow as containing both personal and collective unconscious contents that the ego refuses to acknowledge. Klein's (1946) work on splitting demonstrates how anxiety-provoking objects are divided into 'all good' and 'all bad' categories. Bion's (1961) research shows how groups project internal anxieties onto external threats (fight-flight assumption), leading to aggressive defensive postures that neglect internal vulnerabilities."
