  "description": {
    "short": "Measures the unconscious emotional reactions and biases that security professionals develop toward threats, systems, and individuals they protect, creating systematic blind spots in defense strategies",
    "context": "Security teams unconsciously develop emotional attachments to certain threats, systems, or attack types, creating systematic blind spots in defense strategies. This psychological bias causes teams to over-focus on sophisticated attacks they admire while neglecting mundane but effective threats, or to resist changes to beloved systems regardless of security risks. These emotional blind spots directly enable attackers who exploit predictable defensive gaps.",
    "impact": "Organizations with countertransference blind spots experience security investments driven by team emotional preferences rather than business risk priorities, disproportionate attention to certain threat types while neglecting others, and resistance to changing established security approaches even when evidence supports change. This leads to strategic misalignment, operational dysfunction, and predictable defensive gaps that sophisticated attackers systematically exploit.",
    "psychological_basis": "Countertransference represents unconscious emotional reactions security professionals develop toward threats and systems. Originally conceptualized in psychoanalytic theory (Jung 1969, Klein 1946), it manifests through unconscious identification with sophisticated attackers, emotional attachment to protected systems, and projection of internal organizational conflicts onto external threats. Neuroscience fMRI studies demonstrate that emotional centers activate before rational analysis when experts encounter threats to their domain expertise, while mirror neuron research explains unconscious identification with sophisticated attack patterns."
