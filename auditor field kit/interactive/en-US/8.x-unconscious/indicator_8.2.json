  "description": {
    "short": "Measures the degree to which security professionals unconsciously adopt characteristics, methods, or mindsets of threat actors they defend against, creating insider risk through identification with attackers",
    "context": "Security professionals who spend extensive time analyzing attack methods may unconsciously adopt attacker mindsets, tools, or values. This psychological shift creates insider risk as defenders blur boundaries between understanding threats and identifying with them. Organizations experience policy violations, scope creep in testing, and gradual erosion of security controls when team members unconsciously mirror the behaviors they're meant to defend against.",
    "impact": "This vulnerability creates insider threats from trusted security professionals, scope creep in penetration testing, policy exceptions that erode security controls, and susceptibility to social engineering that appeals to adopted hacker identity. Historical examples include shadow IT proliferation by security-aware employees and penetration testing boundary violations.",
    "psychological_basis": "Anna Freud's (1936) concept of 'identification with the aggressor' describes how individuals adopt characteristics of threatening agents as a defense mechanism. Klein's (1946) projective identification shows how individuals project aspects onto others then identify with those projections. Mirror neuron research (Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004) demonstrates automatic neurological simulation of observed behaviors, creating potential for unconscious identification."
