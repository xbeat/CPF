  "description": {
    "short": "Measures how unconscious psychological defenses distort security decision-making and create systematic blind spots in threat perception",
    "context": "Defense mechanisms—denial, projection, rationalization, intellectualization—operate below conscious awareness to reduce anxiety about organizational vulnerability. While protecting the psyche from overwhelming threat information, these mechanisms paradoxically create security blind spots by filtering anxiety-provoking realities, minimizing genuine risks, and externalizing responsibility for vulnerabilities.",
    "impact": "Organizations with strong defense mechanism interference experience delayed incident response, consistent underinvestment in security relative to stated risk awareness, and systematic gaps between security policies and actual practices. Security threats that trigger anxiety are unconsciously minimized while comfortable but ineffective security measures are prioritized.",
    "psychological_basis": "Anna Freud's (1936) defense mechanism theory demonstrates automatic unconscious filtering of threatening information. Klein's (1946) object relations theory shows how splitting and projection create systematic perception gaps. Festinger's (1957) cognitive dissonance research explains filtering of conflicting security information through defensive psychological processes."
