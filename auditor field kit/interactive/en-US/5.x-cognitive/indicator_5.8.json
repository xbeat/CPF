  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to lingering cognitive interference from previous tasks affecting current security judgments and creating systematic blind spots in threat detection",
    "context": "Attention residue effects occur when security analysts switch between tasks without completing their mental processing, leaving cognitive resources 'stuck' on the previous task. This creates systematic blind spots where analysts miss genuine threats immediately after handling complex investigations, tool switches, or interruptions. Organizations with frequent task switching, multiple security tools, or interrupt-heavy workflows face elevated risk of missing critical security incidents due to degraded analyst cognitive performance.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high attention residue experience increased false negatives in threat detection, delayed incident response, and systematic vulnerabilities during high-alert periods. Security analysts' detection accuracy drops significantly in the 15-30 minutes following high-cognitive-load tasks. Historical incidents including the Target Corporation breach (2013) and Equifax breach show evidence of attention residue contributing to delayed recognition of critical threats.",
    "psychological_basis": "Sophie Leroy's (2009) seminal research on attention residue demonstrated measurable performance degradation when tasks are switched without completion. Miller's (1956) working memory limitations provide theoretical foundation - cognitive capacity is strictly bounded. fMRI studies demonstrate that incomplete tasks maintain activation in the prefrontal cortex even during subsequent activities (Monk et al., 2008), creating persistent interference with new task processing."
