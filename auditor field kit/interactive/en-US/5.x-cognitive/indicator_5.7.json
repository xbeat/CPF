  "description": {
    "short": "Measures cognitive failures when concurrent information requirements exceed working memory capacity (7±2 items), leading to security errors and missed threats",
    "context": "Working memory overflow occurs when security professionals must simultaneously process more information than their cognitive capacity allows (typically 7±2 items). This creates a cascading failure where critical security details are missed, errors increase exponentially, and decision quality deteriorates. Attackers exploit this by timing attacks during peak cognitive load periods or deliberately overwhelming teams with multiple alerts to mask real threats.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high working memory overflow experience missed threat detections, increased security errors during high-alert periods, delayed incident response, and vulnerability exploitation during cognitive saturation. Historical incidents include Target 2013 breach (multiple concurrent alerts prevented pattern recognition), Equifax 2017 (concurrent vulnerability management overwhelmed teams), and SolarWinds supply chain attack (sustained cognitive load prevented detection).",
    "psychological_basis": "Miller's (1956) seminal discovery of the 'magical number seven, plus or minus two' - the fundamental limitation of human working memory capacity to hold approximately 7±2 discrete chunks of information simultaneously. Baddeley & Hitch (1974) working memory model identifying central executive's limited capacity. When capacity is exceeded, information displacement, processing degradation, error propagation, and decision paralysis occur. Neuroscience shows prefrontal cortex activation increases linearly with load until capacity is exceeded, then network breakdown occurs."
