  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to systematic errors when cybersecurity systems overwhelm human cognitive capacity through excessive complexity",
    "context": "When security procedures require processing more than 7±2 information chunks simultaneously, users default to simplified shortcuts that create predictable vulnerabilities. Complex authentication systems, overwhelming dashboards, and byzantine security procedures drive workarounds that attackers systematically exploit.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high complexity experience systematic procedure bypasses, security tool abandonment, misconfigurations, and increased error rates under normal conditions. Complex systems create cognitive overload leading to ransomware propagation through workarounds, control bypasses during high-volume periods, and systematic security failures.",
    "psychological_basis": "Miller's (1956) 'magical number seven' principle demonstrates working memory can only process 7±2 information chunks simultaneously. Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory shows that when complexity exceeds capacity, System 1 processing takes over, leading to heuristic-based errors. Neurologically, prefrontal cortex overload impairs threat detection accuracy by up to 40%."
