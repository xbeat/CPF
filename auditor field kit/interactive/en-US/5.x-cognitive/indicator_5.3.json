    "short": "Measures vulnerability to decision paralysis and delayed responses when security personnel become overwhelmed by excessive alerts, data streams, or complex decisions that exceed human processing capacity",
    "context": "Information overload paralysis occurs when security personnel become overwhelmed by excessive alerts, data streams, or complex decisions, leading to delayed responses or poor security choices. This vulnerability emerges when information volume exceeds human processing capacity (approximately 7 items simultaneously), causing decision-making systems to shut down or default to shortcuts. In cybersecurity contexts, this manifests as analysts missing critical threats buried in alert storms, delayed incident response during complex multi-vector attacks, or security teams becoming paralyzed when facing multiple simultaneous crises.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high information overload vulnerability experience delayed incident response, missed critical threats in alert noise, and poor decision-making during complex security events. Historical incidents include the 2017 Equifax breach where critical Apache Struts vulnerability information was lost in an avalanche of security updates, the 2020 SolarWinds attack where threat intelligence overload masked sophisticated supply chain indicators, and Target's 2013 breach where FireEye alerts were lost in daily security notification floods. These incidents demonstrate how information overload creates systematic security blind spots regardless of technical capability.",
    "psychological_basis": "Miller's cognitive capacity research (1956) demonstrates humans can effectively process 7±2 discrete information units simultaneously. When information exceeds this capacity, the brain's executive function becomes compromised through working memory saturation, attention fragmentation, and analysis paralysis. Under cognitive overload, attention narrows to immediate concerns (cognitive tunneling), creating blind spots to security implications. Neurobiological evidence shows prefrontal cortex deactivation under extreme cognitive load, with stress hormones further impairing working memory. Kahneman's dual-process theory (2011) explains how System 2 (slow, deliberate thinking) shuts down when overwhelmed, causing security decisions to default to heuristic-based shortcuts rather than careful analysis."
