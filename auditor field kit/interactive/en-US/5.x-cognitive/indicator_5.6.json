  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to narrowed attention focus that leads to neglect of peripheral security indicators during high-stress or high-concentration activities",
    "context": "Cognitive tunneling occurs when security teams become so intensely focused on immediate threats or technical problems that they lose awareness of other critical security activities happening simultaneously. This psychological state creates dangerous blind spots where attackers can exploit secondary attack vectors while security personnel are tunnel-focused on primary incidents. Organizations experience this when SOC analysts miss coordinated attacks, incident responders overlook related compromises, or technical teams bypass security controls while focused on urgent operational issues.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high cognitive tunneling vulnerability experience successful multi-vector attacks where primary obvious threats distract from sophisticated lateral movement, missed attack correlation across security domains, and security control bypasses during urgent operations. Historical incidents include Target (2013) breach where teams tunnel-focused on POS malware while missing broader network compromise, Equifax (2017) where urgent patching activities created blind spots for Apache Struts exploitation, SolarWinds (2020) where focus on traditional IOCs missed supply chain compromise, and Sony Pictures (2014) where asset protection focus led to insufficient attention to email systems.",
    "psychological_basis": "Miller's Cognitive Load Theory (1956) demonstrates working memory can only process 7±2 items simultaneously, causing attention narrowing when capacity is exceeded. Kahneman's Attention Theory (1973) shows attention operates as limited resource with automatic narrowing under high cognitive load. Wickens' Multiple Resource Theory (1984) demonstrates tunneling intensifies when tasks compete for same mental resources. Endsley's Situation Awareness Research (1995) identifies cognitive tunneling as primary factor in awareness failures under stress. fMRI studies show during tunneling, anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex focus on specific pathways while broader monitoring networks show decreased activation."
