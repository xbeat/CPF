  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability from security teams becoming psychologically numb to security alerts due to overwhelming volume or frequent false positives",
    "context": "Alert fatigue desensitization occurs when security teams become psychologically numb to security alerts due to overwhelming volume or frequent false positives. This creates a dangerous blind spot where genuine threats are dismissed or overlooked because staff have unconsciously 'tuned out' alert systems. Organizations experiencing this vulnerability often miss critical security incidents hiding among routine alerts, leading to delayed breach detection and extended attacker dwell time.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high alert fatigue experience missed critical security incidents, increased time to detection, and systematic security blind spots. Historical incidents include Target Corporation (2013) where analysts dismissed actual breach alerts as false positives, Anthem (2015) where security teams reported 'alert blindness' from overwhelming false positive volumes, and Equifax (2017) where critical vulnerability alerts were ignored due to overwhelming notification volumes. This vulnerability enables attackers to conduct alert flooding attacks, low-and-slow data exfiltration, and temporal exploitation during periods of maximum desensitization.",
    "psychological_basis": "Alert fatigue operates through habituation response (nervous system reducing responsiveness to repeated non-threatening stimuli), attention resource depletion (finite cognitive resources exhausted by continuous alert processing), and sensory adaptation (cognitive system adapting to constant alert levels). Research basis includes Miller's Cognitive Load Theory (1956) demonstrating humans can only process 5-9 discrete information units simultaneously, Kahneman's Attention Theory showing System 1 processing dominates in high-cognitive-load environments, neurological research demonstrating progressive amygdala activation reduction with repeated warning stimuli, and vigilance decrement studies showing performance degradation after 20-30 minutes of sustained attention tasks."
