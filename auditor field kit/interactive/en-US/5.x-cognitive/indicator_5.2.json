    "short": "Measures vulnerability to degraded security decision quality when employees make too many decisions in a short time period, causing judgment deterioration and increased susceptibility to shortcuts and poor choices",
    "context": "Decision fatigue occurs when people make too many security decisions in a short time period, causing their judgment quality to deteriorate. This creates cybersecurity vulnerability because tired decision-makers take shortcuts, accept defaults without review, or avoid making necessary security choices altogether. Organizations see this manifest as security alerts being dismissed in bulk, policy exceptions approved without proper review, and poor password choices during busy periods.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high decision fatigue experience successful timing-based social engineering attacks, alert flood incidents leading to missed breach indicators, business email compromise during peak decision periods, and privilege escalation via exception requests. Historical incidents include the Target Corporation breach (2013) where decision fatigue contributed to delayed threat response, and FBI statistics showing 60% higher success rates for BEC attacks sent after 3 PM.",
    "psychological_basis": "Decision fatigue represents a state of mental exhaustion caused by making too many decisions, leading to deteriorating quality of choices over time. This phenomenon occurs when the cognitive resources required for decision-making become depleted through repeated use, resulting in one of three predictable outcomes: impulsive decisions (choosing the first available option), avoidance decisions (postponing or delegating), or default decisions (maintaining status quo regardless of optimality). The psychological mechanism operates through the depletion of glucose in the prefrontal cortex, with research by Baumeister et al. (1998) demonstrating that willpower and decision-making share the same finite cognitive resource. Kahneman's System 1/System 2 framework shows how cognitive load shifts processing from deliberate to automatic modes."
