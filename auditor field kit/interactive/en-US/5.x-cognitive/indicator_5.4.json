  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability arising from systematic reduction in cognitive performance when security personnel attempt to manage multiple information streams or tasks simultaneously",
    "context": "Multitasking degradation occurs when security personnel attempt to monitor multiple systems, respond to alerts, and handle administrative tasks simultaneously, leading to systematic reduction in threat detection accuracy and incident response quality. This vulnerability stems from fundamental cognitive limitations in human attention and working memory, creating windows of opportunity that sophisticated attackers actively exploit by timing attacks during periods of divided attention.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high multitasking demands experience reduced threat detection rates, slower incident response times, and increased security decision errors. Historical incidents include Target (2013) where security teams managing multiple monitoring systems failed to investigate early warnings, Anthem (2015) where concurrent alerts led to delayed attack recognition, Equifax (2017) where teams managing multiple responsibilities missed critical Apache Struts alerts, and SolarWinds (2020) where attackers exploited periods of divided attention during COVID-19 security changes.",
    "psychological_basis": "Miller's cognitive capacity research (1956) demonstrates humans can effectively maintain only 5-9 information chunks simultaneously. Attention switching creates measurable delays (200-500ms) and performance decrements. Leroy's attention residue research (2009) shows that when transitioning between tasks, part of attention remains stuck on the previous task, reducing capacity for new security threats. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) demonstrates that exceeding capacity limits leads to systematic performance degradation. Neuroimaging studies show multitasking activates different neural networks than focused attention, with reduced activity in deep processing areas."
