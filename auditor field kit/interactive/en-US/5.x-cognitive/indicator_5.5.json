  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to security lapses when personnel must rapidly alternate between different tools, systems, or mental frameworks, creating cognitive overload that reduces decision-making quality",
    "context": "Context switching vulnerabilities occur when security personnel must rapidly alternate between different tools, systems, or mental frameworks, creating cognitive overload that reduces decision-making quality. This happens because human working memory can only effectively process 7±2 elements simultaneously, and switching between security contexts (like moving from email alerts to network monitoring to incident response) leaves 'attention residue' that impairs performance. Organizations with fragmented security tools and processes force constant context switching, creating systematic blind spots that attackers can exploit during these cognitive transition periods.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high context switching vulnerabilities experience increased mean time to detection during cognitive transition periods, reduced incident response quality, and systematic detection failures when attacks span multiple security domains. Historical incidents include the 2013 Target breach where analysts managing multiple concurrent alert streams experienced delayed recognition of attack scope, and the 2019 Norsk Hydro ransomware attack where attackers flooded SOC analysts with false positives across multiple tools while spreading through less-monitored systems. The 2020 SolarWinds breach investigation found evidence that attackers specifically timed activities during known SOC shift changes to exploit context switching vulnerabilities.",
    "psychological_basis": "Rooted in Miller's (1956) work on working memory limitations and the 'magical number seven,' which established that human cognitive capacity for processing information simultaneously is severely constrained. When individuals rapidly switch contexts, they experience 'attention residue' (Leroy, 2009) where cognitive resources remain partially allocated to the previous task. fMRI studies demonstrate that prefrontal cortex reconfiguration during context switches creates measurable delays (300-500ms) and reduces overall cognitive efficiency by 25-40% during transition periods. Task-switching research (Rubinstein et al., 2001) shows systematic 'switch costs' - measurable delays and error increases that compound in high-stakes cybersecurity contexts."
