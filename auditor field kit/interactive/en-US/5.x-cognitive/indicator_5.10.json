  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability arising from misalignment between users' mental models of security systems and actual system functioning, leading to predictable errors in security-relevant decisions",
    "context": "Mental model confusion occurs when employees' understanding of how security systems work doesn't match how they actually function. This creates predictable vulnerabilities because people make security decisions based on incorrect assumptions about system behavior. Organizations experience this when systems change but user training doesn't update, when multiple security tools work differently, or when complex systems exceed what people can reasonably understand and remember.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high mental model confusion experience configuration errors, monitoring blind spots, incident response delays, and security workarounds. When mental models lag behind system reality, attackers exploit gaps through interface spoofing, privilege escalation via model gaps, and social engineering via technical confusion. This vulnerability peaks during system updates when users struggle to adapt their internal representations.",
    "psychological_basis": "Miller's Cognitive Load Theory (1956) - Working memory capacity limitations create vulnerabilities when systems exceed the 'magical number seven.' Norman's Design Psychology shows mental models are simplified representations that help predict system behavior. Kahneman's System 1/System 2 Framework demonstrates that under cognitive load, fast automatic processing relies heavily on mental models. Schema Theory (Bartlett, 1932) reveals that cognitive schemas actively reconstruct information to fit existing models, filtering contradictory security information."
