    "short": "Measures organizational vulnerability to rapid stress propagation through teams creating amplifying feedback loops that progressively degrade collective security decision-making capacity",
    "context": "Stress contagion cascades represent a systemic organizational vulnerability where acute stress states spread rapidly through interconnected teams and departments. This phenomenon operates through emotional contagion via mirror neuron activation and unconscious mimicry of stress behaviors, amplification mechanisms where each individual's stress intensifies the collective stress field creating exponential escalation, and systemic breakdown as stress reaches critical thresholds across multiple nodes simultaneously degrading collective threat assessment and incident response capacity.",
    "impact": "Target 2013 breach occurred during holiday season stress peaks when cascading pressure degraded security team vigilance. Equifax 2017 showed organizational stress from multiple vulnerabilities created cascade conditions preventing proper coordination. NotPetya/WannaCry 2017 demonstrated that organizations with pre-existing stress conditions experienced more severe impacts as cascades prevented effective coordinated response. SolarWinds 2020 showed prolonged stress cascading through multiple organizations amplifying overall impact and recovery time.",
    "psychological_basis": "Mirror neuron research (Rizzolatti 2004) demonstrates automatic neurological mimicry of observed emotional states. Polyvagal theory (Porges 2011) explains how autonomic nervous system states synchronize between individuals through unconscious detection of safety/threat cues. Hatfield's emotional contagion research shows stress states spread through organizations via automatic mimicry and physiological synchronization. Christakis & Fowler's network studies reveal emotional states propagate through social networks up to three degrees of separation."
