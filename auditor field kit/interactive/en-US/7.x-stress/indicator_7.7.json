  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attentional narrowing under stress that causes security teams to miss critical peripheral security indicators while focusing exclusively on immediate obvious threats",
    "context": "Stress-induced tunnel vision represents a fundamental neurobiological response where acute or chronic stress narrows cognitive processing to focus exclusively on immediate perceived threats while filtering out peripheral information crucial for comprehensive security assessment. This phenomenon occurs through activation of the sympathetic nervous system and HPA axis, which floods the system with stress hormones creating a cognitive 'spotlight' that illuminates only a fraction of the total information environment. The mechanism operates through attentional narrowing, working memory degradation, and increased reliance on heuristic shortcuts that may be inappropriate for novel or complex security threats.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high-stress environments systematically miss security incidents that fall outside their immediate focus area. The Target breach (2013) exemplifies this - overwhelming alerts caused teams to miss sophisticated APT indicators while focused on known threat patterns. During high-stress periods, response times increase, false positive/negative rates worsen, and complex multi-vector attacks succeed while teams remain focused narrowly on initial attack symptoms rather than comprehensive threat landscape assessment.",
    "psychological_basis": "Yerkes-Dodson Law demonstrates performance follows an inverted-U curve relative to arousal levels - beyond optimal arousal, increased stress leads to performance degradation, with complex cognitive tasks showing earlier degradation than simple tasks. Easterbrook's cue utilization theory explains how stress narrows attention span exponentially. LeDoux's research on the amygdala shows stress responses occur 300-500ms before conscious awareness, meaning tunnel vision effects begin before individuals recognize they are experiencing stress."
