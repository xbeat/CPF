  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to aggressive defensive responses under stress that compromise security decision-making through overreaction, resource waste, and alienation of business stakeholders",
    "context": "Fight response aggression occurs when security teams react to threats with immediate, maximum-intensity responses before completing proper threat assessment. This psychological pattern creates cybersecurity vulnerabilities because it leads to resource waste, false positive floods, business disruption, and blinds organizations to actual sophisticated attacks while teams chase aggressive but ineffective defensive actions. Organizations with this pattern often alienate business units, make poor threat attribution decisions, and create operational instability that attackers can exploit.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high fight response vulnerability experience frequent overreactions to security alerts, hostile relationships between security and business units, aggressive tool configurations that disrupt operations, and wasteful security resource allocation. Attackers deliberately trigger aggressive responses through provocation-based attacks, escalation traps, and false flag operations. Historical incidents including Sony Pictures (2014) and various penetration testing conflicts demonstrate how aggressive security postures can be exploited by sophisticated adversaries.",
    "psychological_basis": "Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (1956) identifies the fight response as an alarm phase reaction where the body mobilizes resources for immediate threat response. Cannon's Fight-or-Flight Response describes sympathetic nervous system activation that prioritizes immediate survival over complex reasoning. LeDoux (2000) demonstrated that amygdala activation occurs 300-500ms before prefrontal cortex engagement, meaning aggressive security responses often occur before conscious threat assessment. Porges' Polyvagal Theory shows the fight response represents a phylogenetically older defensive strategy that emerges when more sophisticated social engagement systems fail."
