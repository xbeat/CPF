  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to stress-induced cognitive impairment during high-pressure security incidents that compromise decision-making and protocol adherence",
    "context": "Acute stress impairment occurs when high-pressure security incidents trigger fight-or-flight responses that compromise cognitive function, decision-making, and adherence to security protocols. During critical moments like system breaches, ransomware attacks, or urgent threat notifications, even experienced security professionals make errors due to stress-induced cognitive tunneling, reduced working memory, and reliance on shortcuts rather than proper procedures. This vulnerability creates windows of opportunity for attackers who deliberately exploit time pressure and emergency conditions to bypass security controls.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high acute stress vulnerability experience critical errors during incident response, bypassed security protocols under pressure, and suboptimal security decisions during crisis periods. Attackers deliberately trigger stress responses through simultaneous multi-vector attacks, time-pressure tactics, and information flooding to exploit cognitive overload. Historical incidents including Target (2013), Equifax (2017), and SolarWinds (2020) involved stress-induced decision errors that amplified breach impact.",
    "psychological_basis": "Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (1956) provides the foundational model for acute stress as the initial alarm reaction phase. LeDoux (2000) demonstrated that amygdala activation occurs 300-500ms before prefrontal cortex engagement, meaning threat responses precede rational analysis. Acute stress floods the system with stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, norepinephrine), narrows attention through cognitive tunneling, reduces working memory capacity, impairs complex reasoning, and increases reliance on automatic behaviors rather than deliberate security protocols."
