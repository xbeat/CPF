  "description": {
    "short": "Measures organizational vulnerability during the 24-72 hours following crisis resolution when reduced vigilance and overconfidence create windows for secondary attacks",
    "context": "Recovery period vulnerabilities emerge from the complex psychophysiological aftermath of acute stress responses when individuals and organizations transition from crisis mode back to normal operations. This operates through cortisol clearance delay where elevated stress hormones persist 24-72 hours impairing executive function, cognitive resource depletion from crisis response creating temporary reduced mental capacity, and hypervigilance fatigue causing rebound effect with temporarily impaired attention and threat detection. The vulnerability exploits the neurobiological reality that recovery is not simply absence of stress but an active process requiring cognitive and emotional resources.",
    "impact": "Organizations consistently show increased error rates and security lapses in 48-72 hours following crisis resolution. Post-breach secondary attacks show 40% higher success rate when launched during recovery windows. Financial institutions experience secondary fraud increases following successful defense against initial cyber attacks. Healthcare systems suffer data breaches during recovery from ransomware incidents they successfully contained. Multiple organizations successfully defending against major DDoS attacks subsequently fall victim to simple phishing campaigns during recovery.",
    "psychological_basis": "Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (1956) identifies exhaustion phase following alarm and resistance where organism's adaptive capacity is temporarily compromised. HPA axis research shows cortisol remains elevated 24-72 hours post-stressor even after perceived threat passes. Baumeister's ego depletion studies demonstrate self-control and decision-making quality impaired following intensive cognitive effort. Kaplan's Attention Restoration Theory shows focused attention capacity requires recovery time during which vigilance is naturally reduced."
