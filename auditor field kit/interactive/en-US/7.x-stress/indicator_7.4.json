  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to systematic avoidance of security decision-making during high-stress situations, creating dangerous delays that attackers exploit",
    "context": "Flight response avoidance manifests when security personnel systematically avoid making critical security decisions or confronting security issues during high-stress situations, instead deferring, delegating, or delaying action. This psychological pattern creates dangerous security gaps because attackers exploit the decision delays and avoidance behaviors to maintain persistence and expand their access during the crucial early phases when containment would be most effective.",
    "impact": "Organizations with flight response patterns experience unexplained delays in incident response, reluctance to escalate security issues, and security decisions that become stuck in committee during critical moments. Attackers time their activities during periods when key personnel exhibit avoidance behaviors, such as end-of-quarter business pressure or major system updates. Historical incidents include Target (2013) and Equifax (2017) where delayed responses to initial breach indicators allowed extended attacker dwell time.",
    "psychological_basis": "Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 2011) shows flight response represents activation of the sympathetic nervous system's mobilization branch when social engagement fails. Seligman's Learned Helplessness Research (1972) demonstrates that repeated exposure to uncontrollable stressors leads to generalized avoidance behaviors. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) shows excessive cognitive demands lead to systematic avoidance of complex tasks as a protective mechanism against cognitive overload."
