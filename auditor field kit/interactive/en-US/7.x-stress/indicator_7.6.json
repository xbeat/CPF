  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to systematic security boundary violations when employees cannot say 'no' to requests due to compulsive people-pleasing and conflict avoidance under stress",
    "context": "The fawn response represents a sophisticated psychological defense mechanism that manifests as excessive compliance, appeasement, and submission when faced with perceived threats or authority. Unlike the more recognized fight-flight-freeze responses, fawning is a relational survival strategy that attempts to neutralize threat through hypervigilant accommodation of others' needs and desires. In organizational contexts, fawn response overcompliance manifests as an inability to enforce security boundaries when doing so might create interpersonal conflict or displease authority figures. Individuals exhibiting this vulnerability will systematically bypass security protocols to avoid disappointing colleagues, supervisors, or external parties, even when they consciously recognize the security risks involved.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high fawn response patterns experience 3x higher rates of social engineering success and insider-enabled breaches. This vulnerability creates systematic security policy exception creep as employees grant inappropriate access levels to avoid interpersonal conflict. Historical incidents include the 2013 Target breach involving HVAC contractor employees who provided credentials after sustained social engineering that exploited fawn responses, and the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist where internal employees provided access after attackers used personal relationships and guilt-based manipulation.",
    "psychological_basis": "The fawn response was first systematically described by Pete Walker (2013) in his work on complex trauma responses, building on Selye's (1956) foundational stress response research. Neurobiological validation comes from polyvagal theory research by Stephen Porges (2011), demonstrating that the dorsal vagal complex activation creates states of submission and freeze-fawn responses. fMRI studies show increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (empathy center) and decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (executive decision-making) during fawn responses."
