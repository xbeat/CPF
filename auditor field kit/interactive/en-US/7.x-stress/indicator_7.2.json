  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to prolonged psychological and physiological exhaustion from sustained organizational stressors that compromise security vigilance and decision-making",
    "context": "Chronic stress burnout occurs when security personnel experience prolonged exhaustion from sustained organizational stressors without adequate recovery periods. This creates a dangerous paradox: those most responsible for protecting the organization become least capable of maintaining vigilance. Burned-out security staff exhibit alert fatigue, make poor decisions under pressure, and become vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Organizations like Target (2013) and Equifax (2017) experienced major breaches partly due to security team burnout that reduced threat detection capabilities.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high burnout vulnerability experience security team turnover, reduced threat detection effectiveness, compliance degradation, and insider threat risk escalation. Burned-out personnel become desensitized to alerts, take shortcuts in security procedures, and may progress to active disengagement. Average CISO tenure of 24 months reflects widespread burnout-related turnover. The Equifax breach involved critical alerts lost among routine notifications processed by exhausted security teams.",
    "psychological_basis": "Maslach and Jackson (1981) identified three core burnout dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (1956) shows chronic stress occurs when individuals remain trapped in resistance phase without resolution, progressing to exhaustion. Hobfoll's Conservation of Resources Theory (1989) explains burnout develops from resource loss without adequate gain. Chronic cortisol elevation impairs hippocampal function and prefrontal cortex degradation reduces executive function essential for security decision-making."
