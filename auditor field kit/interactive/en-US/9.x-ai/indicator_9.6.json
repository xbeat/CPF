    "context": "Machine Learning Opacity Trust represents a critical vulnerability where humans develop inappropriate trust patterns toward AI systems whose decision-making processes are fundamentally opaque or incomprehensible. This vulnerability operates through trust transfer phenomena, cognitive closure seeking, and competence substitution. Users unconsciously substitute assessments of an AI system's competence in areas they can evaluate (interface design, speed, technical sophistication) for competence in areas they cannot evaluate (accuracy of hidden decision-making processes, data quality, algorithmic bias). This creates security risks when staff accept AI recommendations without verification, making organizations vulnerable to AI-mediated attacks, model poisoning, and decision manipulation.",
    "impact": "Organizations vulnerable to Machine Learning Opacity Trust experience increased risk of AI-mediated attacks, inappropriate trust in automated systems, and reduced critical thinking when evaluating AI recommendations.",
    "psychological_basis": "Trust transfer phenomena and automation bias create vulnerability when humans develop inappropriate confidence in opaque or biased AI systems without adequate verification processes."
