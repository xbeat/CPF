  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to inconsistent trust patterns with AI security systems - simultaneously rejecting and over-relying on algorithmic recommendations",
    "context": "Organizations exhibit inconsistent trust patterns with AI security systems - simultaneously rejecting algorithmic recommendations when they conflict with human intuition while over-relying on AI in inappropriate contexts. This paradox creates predictable attack vectors where threat actors exploit either algorithm rejection (bypassing AI security controls) or over-reliance (manipulating AI systems or spoofing AI authority). The vulnerability manifests when security teams disable AI tools after false positives, blindly trust AI recommendations without verification, or make inconsistent decisions about when to override algorithmic security controls.",
    "impact": "Organizations with algorithm aversion paradox experience security tool bypass exploitation after AI false positives, AI authority social engineering where attackers spoof AI verification, adversarial AI manipulation while staff blindly trust compromised recommendations, and alert fatigue amplification where staff dismiss AI warnings more readily than human alerts.",
    "psychological_basis": "Dietvorst et al. (2015) demonstrated people abandon algorithmic forecasts after seeing them err compared to identical human error rates - algorithm aversion increases after observing AI mistakes. Burton et al. (2020) showed algorithm aversion increases when people can modify outputs, suggesting control needs drive the paradox. Logg et al. (2019) found 'algorithm appreciation' in domains where human limitations are acknowledged, creating domain-specific trust patterns. fMRI studies reveal amygdala activation when humans observe algorithmic errors, suggesting threat response to AI mistakes exceeds response to human errors."
