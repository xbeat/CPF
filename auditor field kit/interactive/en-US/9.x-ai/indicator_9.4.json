  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to inappropriately transferring human authority structures and deference behaviors to AI systems",
    "context": "AI authority transfer occurs when employees unconsciously delegate critical decision-making to AI systems, treating artificial intelligence as an infallible authority rather than a tool requiring human oversight. This psychological vulnerability creates cybersecurity risk because staff bypass normal verification processes, accept AI recommendations without validation, and may implement AI-suggested actions that compromise security controls. Organizations experience this as employees saying 'the AI recommended it' as justification for decisions that wouldn't normally be approved through standard human authority channels.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high AI authority transfer vulnerability experience AI impersonation social engineering where attackers spoof AI systems, prompt injection security bypass through manipulated AI outputs, AI-validated phishing campaigns with higher success rates, and automated decision cascade failures where compromised AI systems make multiple bad decisions that employees implement without verification.",
    "psychological_basis": "Milgram's obedience studies (1974) demonstrated profound predisposition to comply with authority figures - AI authority transfer extends this by showing appearance of authority triggers similar compliance. Automation bias studies in aviation show pilots defer to automated systems even when incorrect. Trust in technology research shows humans develop trust relationships with technology mirroring interpersonal trust but with faster initial formation and greater tolerance for AI errors until threshold crossed. Cognitive Load Theory explains that under overload humans increasingly rely on authority cues, with AI presenting itself as solution to cognitive complexity."
