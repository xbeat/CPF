    "context": "AI Hallucination Acceptance represents a novel cognitive vulnerability where individuals systematically fail to question or verify AI-generated information, even when it contains demonstrable errors or fabrications. This vulnerability emerges from authority transfer mechanisms, anthropomorphization processes, and cognitive offloading. Humans naturally attribute human-like intelligence to AI systems and transfer authority they associate with human expertise to AI, while experiencing information overload leads to delegating fact-checking to AI systems. This creates security risks through AI-mediated social engineering, false authority creation, decision pollution, and trust exploitation where critical security decisions become based on unverified AI-generated content.",
    "impact": "Organizations vulnerable to AI Hallucination Acceptance experience increased risk of AI-mediated attacks, inappropriate trust in automated systems, and reduced critical thinking when evaluating AI recommendations.",
    "psychological_basis": "Trust transfer phenomena and automation bias create vulnerability when humans develop inappropriate confidence in opaque or biased AI systems without adequate verification processes."
