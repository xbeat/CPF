    "context": "Human-AI Team Dysfunction emerges from the fundamental mismatch between human psychological expectations of team collaboration and the operational realities of AI systems. Unlike human teammates who share emotional context and implicit communication patterns, AI systems operate through deterministic algorithms that lack genuine understanding of human psychological states. This vulnerability operates through anthropomorphic projection where humans unconsciously attribute human-like mental states and social awareness to AI systems, creating false sense of mutual understanding that breaks down under pressure. This leads to coordination failures, inappropriate trust calibration, and communication breakdowns that attackers exploit through AI impersonation, coordination disruption, trust manipulation, and cognitive overload amplification.",
    "impact": "Organizations vulnerable to Human-AI Team Dysfunction experience increased risk of AI-mediated attacks, inappropriate trust in automated systems, and reduced critical thinking when evaluating AI recommendations.",
    "psychological_basis": "Trust transfer phenomena and automation bias create vulnerability when humans develop inappropriate confidence in opaque or biased AI systems without adequate verification processes."
