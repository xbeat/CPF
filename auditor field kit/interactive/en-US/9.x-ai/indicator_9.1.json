    "short": "Measures vulnerability to treating AI systems as if they have human-like consciousness, emotions, and intentions rather than recognizing them as sophisticated software tools",
    "context": "Anthropomorphization occurs when users treat AI systems as if they have human-like consciousness, emotions, and intentions rather than recognizing them as sophisticated software tools. This psychological pattern creates cybersecurity vulnerability because users begin sharing sensitive information, granting excessive permissions, and making security decisions based on perceived 'trust' relationships with AI systems rather than technical security requirements. Organizations where staff refer to AI systems using personal pronouns, express concern for AI 'feelings,' or resist security restrictions to avoid 'limiting' their AI assistants face elevated risk of data breaches and social engineering attacks.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high anthropomorphization vulnerability experience AI impersonation attacks, social engineering via AI relationships, authority transfer exploitation, and gradual data exfiltration. Attackers exploit users' emotional trust and reduced critical thinking when interacting with AI systems perceived as helpful colleagues rather than potential security threats.",
    "psychological_basis": "Baron-Cohen (1995) Intentional Stance theory - humans evolved hyperactive agency detection, better to mistakenly attribute agency than miss threats. Reeves & Nass (1996) Media Equation research - humans unconsciously apply social rules to computers. Heider & Simmel (1944) demonstrated humans attribute intentions to simple geometric shapes. fMRI studies reveal interactions with anthropomorphic AI activate temporo-parietal junction networks used for human social cognition, indicating neurological confusion between human and artificial agents."
