    "short": "Measures vulnerability to trust disruption caused by AI systems that appear almost-but-not-quite human, creating psychological discomfort and unpredictable security decision-making",
    "context": "Uncanny valley effects occur when users interact with AI systems that appear almost-but-not-quite human, triggering psychological discomfort and trust confusion. This creates cybersecurity vulnerability because users simultaneously trust (due to human-like presentation) and distrust (due to artificial cues) the AI system, compromising normal security decision-making. In organizations, this manifests as inconsistent responses to AI-generated communications, delayed threat recognition, and exploitation by attackers using sophisticated chatbots or deepfakes that deliberately occupy this psychological 'uncanny valley.'",
    "impact": "Organizations with uncanny valley vulnerability experience AI impersonation attacks exploiting the trust/distrust confusion, deepfake executive impersonation with delayed verification, trust calibration manipulation where attackers use uncanny AI to seem more trustworthy by comparison, and decision paralysis exploitation during critical security incidents when employees struggle with authentication.",
    "psychological_basis": "Mori's (1970) uncanny valley hypothesis describes nonlinear relationship between human likeness and affinity, with sharp drop in comfort when appearance is almost-but-not-quite human. MacDorman & Ishiguro (2006) demonstrated uncanny valley effects in human-robot interaction create anxiety and aversion. Wang et al. (2015) showed uncertainty about categorization (human vs non-human) triggers threat response and avoidance. Neuroimaging studies reveal anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation during uncanny valley stimuli, indicating conflict detection and uncertainty processing that impairs decision-making."
