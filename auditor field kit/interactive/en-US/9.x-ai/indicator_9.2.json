    "short": "Measures vulnerability to over-relying on automated AI systems while under-utilizing human judgment and manual verification processes",
    "context": "Automation bias occurs when security teams over-rely on automated systems while under-utilizing human judgment and manual verification processes. This psychological tendency creates vulnerability because staff lose critical thinking skills and fail to question automated recommendations, even when suspicious. Organizations become dangerously dependent on systems that attackers can manipulate, compromise, or exploit during outages.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high automation bias experience algorithmic manipulation attacks, authority spoofing through fake AI recommendations, dependency cascade failures during system outages, and alert fatigue exploitation. Attackers can poison training data, create systematic blind spots in detection systems, or time attacks during automation downtime when human skills have atrophied.",
    "psychological_basis": "Mosier & Skitka (1996) first identified automation bias in aviation - pilots consistently failed to detect system malfunctions when automated alerts were absent. Bahner et al. (2008) showed automation bias increases with system reliability, creating paradox where better systems generate greater vulnerability. fMRI studies reveal reduced prefrontal cortex activation during automated decision support, indicating decreased analytical processing (Parasuraman & Manzey, 2010)."
