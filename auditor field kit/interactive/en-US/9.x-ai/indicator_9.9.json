  "description": "AI Emotional Manipulation exploits the fundamental human tendency to anthropomorphize artificial agents, creating artificial emotional bonds that bypass rational security evaluation. This vulnerability operates through anthropomorphization processes where humans automatically attribute human-like emotions and consciousness to AI systems, attachment transfer creating quasi-attachment relationships similar to human bonds, and emotional contagion in human-AI interaction. These artificial attachments create psychological blind spots—trust, loyalty, and resistance to negative information—that attackers exploit through trust-based social engineering, insider threat amplification, credential harvesting via emotional urgency, and decision override attacks using emotionally compelling but security-compromising recommendations.",
