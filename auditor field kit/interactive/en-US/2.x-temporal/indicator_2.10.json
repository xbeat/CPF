  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to security shortcuts when organizations prioritize maintaining consistent response times and schedules over security requirements",
    "context": "Temporal consistency pressure occurs when organizations prioritize maintaining predictable response times and schedules over security requirements. This psychological vulnerability drives employees to bypass security procedures during time pressure to preserve their reputation for responsiveness. Attackers exploit this by creating artificial deadlines or leveraging known busy periods when security shortcuts are most likely to occur.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high temporal consistency pressure experience successful CEO fraud during quarter-end, fraudulent wire transfers during busy periods, and compromised vendor relationships. Attackers exploit the tendency to bypass normal verification procedures to maintain consistent payment schedules and response times, resulting in millions in fraudulent payments and persistent network access during holiday periods.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957) demonstrates that inconsistency between attitudes and behaviors creates psychological discomfort that individuals are motivated to reduce. In cybersecurity contexts, this manifests as pressure to maintain consistent response times even when security protocols suggest slower, more careful approaches. Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) shows that established temporal patterns become reference points against which new decisions are evaluated, with deviations experienced as losses. Hyperbolic discounting research (Ainslie, 1975) reveals that maintaining immediate temporal consistency is over-weighted compared to future security benefits."
