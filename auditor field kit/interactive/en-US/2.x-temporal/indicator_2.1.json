  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to security control circumvention when employees face time pressure and urgent deadlines",
    "context": "Urgency-induced security bypass occurs when time pressure causes employees to circumvent security protocols to meet deadlines. Under stress, people prioritize immediate goals (meeting deadlines) over future risks (security incidents), leading to dangerous shortcuts like sharing passwords, skipping approvals, or using unauthorized tools. This vulnerability is exploited by attackers who create artificial urgency to pressure victims into bypassing normal security procedures.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience increased security incidents during deadline periods, successful social engineering attacks exploiting artificial urgency, and normalized security bypass behavior. Historical analysis shows 40% higher success rates for social engineering attacks during quarter-end periods. Incidents include the Target Corporation breach (2013) during peak holiday season and Anthem Healthcare breach (2015) during year-end reporting deadlines.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cognitive Load Overwhelm: Under urgent deadlines, the brain's executive function becomes overwhelmed, leading to a default mode where security protocols are perceived as obstacles rather than protections. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for deliberate decision-making, becomes compromised under time pressure, allowing System 1 (fast, automatic) processing to dominate over System 2 (slow, deliberate) analysis. Prospect Theory Activation: Under urgency, individuals shift from prevention-focused to promotion-focused decision-making, with immediate gains from bypassing security disproportionately valued over future consequences. Stress-Induced Tunnel Vision: Acute stress triggers a neurobiological response that narrows attention to the immediate threat (missing the deadline) while peripheral concerns (security protocols) fade from conscious awareness."
