    "short": "Measures vulnerability during weekend and holiday periods when employees psychologically transition from work mode to personal mode, temporarily suspending security vigilance",
    "context": "Weekend and holiday periods create systematic security vulnerabilities when employees psychologically transition from 'work mode' to 'personal mode,' temporarily suspending their security vigilance. This cognitive shift, combined with reduced IT monitoring and delayed response capabilities, creates predictable windows that attackers exploit. Organizations experience measurably longer incident response times and higher successful attack rates during these periods due to the natural human tendency to compartmentalize work responsibilities during personal time.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high weekend/holiday vulnerability experience successful ransomware deployments timed for maximum disruption, executive targeting during personal time when security protocols are psychologically offline, and delayed breach detection due to reduced monitoring. Historical patterns show statistical increases in successful social engineering attacks during holiday periods and extended mean-time-to-detection during weekend system outages. The framework's temporal vulnerability category specifically identifies this pattern as predictable and exploitable.",
    "psychological_basis": "Weekend and holiday security lapses emerge from the intersection of circadian rhythm disruption, role boundary confusion, and temporal cognitive load reduction. During non-standard work periods, individuals experience a fundamental shift from their professional security-conscious identity to their personal, relaxed identity state. This psychological transition creates what Winnicott (1971) would describe as a transitional space where normal security protocols become psychologically suspended as individuals navigate between work and personal contexts. The core mechanism involves cognitive schema switching where mental frameworks governing workplace behavior (including security vigilance) become temporarily inaccessible or deprioritized. Attention Restoration Theory (Kaplan, 1995) demonstrates that during restoration periods, individuals naturally reduce environmental scanning and threat assessment behaviors. Temporal Landmark Research (Shum, 1998) shows that weekends and holidays function as temporal landmarks that psychologically separate work time from personal time, creating natural cognitive boundaries where work-related schemas become temporarily dormant."
