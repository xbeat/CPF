  "description": {
    "short": "Measures systematic degradation of security vigilance during extended work periods, irregular shifts, or sustained high-stress operations that deplete cognitive resources needed for sound security decisions",
    "context": "Temporal exhaustion patterns occur when security teams work extended hours, irregular shifts, or face sustained high-stress periods that deplete cognitive resources needed for sound security decisions. This creates predictable windows when staff are more likely to miss threats, skip security procedures, or fall victim to social engineering attacks. Organizations with inadequate fatigue management become vulnerable during night shifts, after major incidents, holiday periods, and extended operational cycles when exhausted personnel make critical security errors.",
    "impact": "Organizations experiencing temporal exhaustion vulnerabilities suffer from increased false positive rates and missed threats during night shifts and extended operations, password security degradation during high-workload periods, and incident response breakdown. Historical incidents include Target Corporation (2013) breach during holiday season with extended IT staff hours, Anthem Healthcare (2015) during concurrent system updates creating sustained cognitive load, and NotPetya (2017) spreading rapidly during European summer holidays with reduced staffing.",
    "psychological_basis": "Ego Depletion Theory (Roy Baumeister) demonstrates that self-control operates like a muscle that becomes fatigued with use. In cybersecurity contexts, continuous vigilance requirements deplete finite psychological resources, progressively impairing judgment. Circadian Rhythm Disruption affects attention, working memory, and risk assessment capabilities. Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome describes how prolonged stress exposure leads to exhaustion characterized by depleted physiological and psychological resources. Neurologically, prefrontal cortex glucose depletion leads to impaired executive function after 2-4 hours of intensive cognitive work, while cortisol dysregulation from chronic stress impairs memory consolidation and threat assessment accuracy."
