  "description": {
    "short": "Measures systematic reduction in cognitive capacity and decision quality under temporal constraints, where time pressure causes staff to shift from careful analytical thinking to fast automatic responses that bypass security considerations",
    "context": "When employees face tight deadlines or urgent demands, their brains shift from careful, analytical thinking to fast, automatic responses that bypass security considerations. This creates predictable windows of vulnerability where staff make security shortcuts, skip verification steps, or fall for attacks that exploit urgency. Organizations with chronic time pressure or poor crisis management see significantly higher rates of successful social engineering attacks and insider security incidents.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high time pressure vulnerability experience deadline-driven phishing success, crisis impersonation attacks, emergency access abuse, and systematic degradation in security practices during busy periods. Historical incidents include Target's delayed threat detection during holiday season pressure, Equifax's incomplete security updates under patch deadlines, and Colonial Pipeline's crisis-driven decision shortcuts.",
    "psychological_basis": "Dual-process theory (Kahneman, 2011) - time pressure suppresses System 2 (deliberate, analytical) processing in favor of System 1 (fast, automatic, heuristic-based) processing. Neurobiologically: prefrontal cortex suppression reduces working memory and cognitive flexibility; amygdala activation floods the brain with cortisol and adrenaline; cognitive tunneling narrows attention to immediate stimuli while peripheral awareness (security considerations) diminishes; working memory overflow exceeds Miller's 7±2 capacity limit, causing superficial processing."
