  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attacks that exploit predictable periods of reduced cognitive performance, decision-making quality, and security awareness during specific time windows",
    "context": "Time-of-day vulnerability windows occur when staff cognitive performance, decision-making quality, and security awareness predictably decline during specific periods (overnight shifts, afternoon crashes, shift changes, end-of-day fatigue). These windows create systematic security gaps that attackers exploit through timing-based social engineering, after-hours 'emergencies,' and reduced monitoring coverage. Organizations with 24/7 operations, multiple shifts, or global teams face amplified risk during these predictable cognitive low points.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience successful after-hours social engineering attacks, shift-change exploitation, weekend emergency scams, and data exfiltration during circadian trough periods. Historical incidents include the Target Corporation breach (2013) where initial compromise occurred during off-peak hours, Equifax incident (2017) with delayed response due to weekend timing, and Sony Pictures attack (2014) during Thanksgiving week with reduced staffing.",
    "psychological_basis": "Time-of-day vulnerability windows emerge from circadian rhythm effects where alertness and working memory fluctuate across 24-hour cycles with dangerous lows between 2-6 AM. Ego depletion accumulation throughout the workday progressively depletes cognitive resources for effortful decision-making. Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory reveals that temporal discounting bias causes systematic devaluation of future consequences under time pressure or cognitive fatigue. Neuroscience research shows decision-making pre-cognitive windows expand during fatigue states (Libet 1983, Soon et al. 2008), with amygdala activation occurring before prefrontal cortex engagement during circadian low points (LeDoux 2000)."
