  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who time malicious activities to coincide with predictable staff transitions, such as security guard changes, SOC analyst handoffs, or IT operations team shifts, exploiting the cognitive load increases, attention fragmentation, and responsibility ambiguity that occur during these periods.",
    "context": "During shift changes, both outgoing and incoming personnel experience increased cognitive load as they process handoff information, orient to new contexts, and manage the transition between different mental models. This creates natural gaps in sustained attention as security monitoring shifts from one person or team to another. The overlap period creates psychological ambiguity about who bears primary responsibility for security vigilance, leading to a 'someone else is watching' mentality. The predictable nature of shift changes creates systematically recurring periods of reduced security awareness that sophisticated attackers can identify and exploit.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high vulnerability to shift change exploitation experience security incidents correlated with transition periods, delayed incident detection following handoffs, and varying security posture based on which shift is on duty. Attackers exploit these windows for lateral movement, malware deployment, physical access breaches, and data exfiltration. Historical incidents include SOC attacks timed to analyst shift changes, data center breaches during operations team handoffs, and industrial espionage incidents timed to maintenance crew transitions.",
    "psychological_basis": "Context switching costs (Monsell, 2003) demonstrate measurable performance decrements when switching between different cognitive contexts. Attention residue effects (Leroy, 2009) show that when attention shifts between tasks, residual attention remains focused on the previous task, reducing performance on the new task. Diffusion of responsibility (Latané & Darley, 1970) demonstrates that when multiple people are present during handoffs, individual sense of responsibility for security monitoring decreases. Working memory limitations (Miller, 1956) demonstrate that during information handoffs, cognitive capacity is temporarily overwhelmed, reducing ability to detect anomalies."
