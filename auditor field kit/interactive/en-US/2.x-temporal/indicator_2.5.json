    "short": "Measures how organizations systematically undervalue future security threats compared to immediate operational concerns, following a psychological pattern where delayed benefits are exponentially discounted",
    "context": "Organizations systematically undervalue future security threats compared to immediate operational concerns, following a psychological pattern where delayed benefits are exponentially discounted. This creates vulnerability because attackers exploit predictable planning blind spots, targeting systems during low-preparation periods and using 'slow burn' attacks that escalate below detection thresholds. The result is chronic underinvestment in preventive security measures while overreacting to immediate threats.",
    "impact": "Organizations with severe hyperbolic discounting experience chronic security technical debt accumulation, successful Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) infiltrations, regulatory compliance cascade failures, and legacy system exploitation. Historical incidents include SolarWinds (2020) multi-year infiltration exploiting deferred supply chain investments, Equifax (2017) unpatched vulnerabilities prioritizing immediate operations over future risk, and WannaCry (2017) delayed Windows updates due to operational disruption concerns.",
    "psychological_basis": "Hyperbolic discounting represents a fundamental bias in temporal decision-making where individuals systematically devalue future outcomes in favor of immediate rewards, following a hyperbolic rather than exponential curve. The psychological mechanism operates through dual-process theory: System 1 processing prioritizes immediate, tangible concerns while System 2's capacity for long-term planning becomes impaired under cognitive load. Research shows discount rates of 30-40% annually for future security investments, with fMRI studies revealing limbic system activation dominating prefrontal cortex engagement in security decision contexts."
