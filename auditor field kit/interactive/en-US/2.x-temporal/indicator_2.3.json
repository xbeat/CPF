  "description": {
    "short": "Measures organizational vulnerability to accepting elevated security risks when facing project deadlines, where time pressure causes systematic bypassing of security protocols and risk assessment procedures",
    "context": "When organizations face tight deadlines, employees systematically bypass security controls to meet time pressures. This creates predictable vulnerability windows where phishing success rates increase, patch management fails, and access controls are circumvented. Under deadline stress, the brain's threat response prioritizes immediate consequences (missing deadlines) over future risks (security breaches), making organizations most vulnerable precisely when they're working hardest.",
    "impact": "Organizations experience deadline exploitation attacks where sophisticated attackers monitor organizational patterns (quarter-end, regulatory deadlines, product launches) to time phishing campaigns when security vigilance is lowest. Success rates increase 300-400% during deadline windows. The 2017 WannaCry attack was particularly devastating for organizations in deadline-protection mode that had deferred patching. Insider threat incidents frequently correlate with deadline periods as legitimate employees share credentials, use unauthorized tools, or bypass access controls under time pressure.",
    "psychological_basis": "Deadline-driven risk acceptance operates through hyperbolic discounting (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), where immediate rewards (meeting deadlines) are overvalued relative to future costs (security breaches). Under time pressure, individuals shift from risk-averse to risk-seeking behavior to avoid the certain loss of missing the deadline. Neurologically, deadline pressure activates the amygdala's threat response 300-500ms before prefrontal cortex engagement (LeDoux, 2000), causing primitive survival responses to dominate rational security considerations. Cognitive Load Theory (Miller, 1956) demonstrates that deadline stress fills cognitive capacity, leaving insufficient working memory for security risk assessment."
