  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to emotional resistance to security updates based on attachment relationships with familiar legacy systems",
    "context": "Organizations develop emotional bonds with legacy systems that extend beyond functional utility, creating psychological resistance to security upgrades and replacements. This attachment manifests when teams treat outdated systems as 'too important to change' despite known vulnerabilities, leading to extended attack windows and increased breach risk. Legacy system attachment creates blind spots where security teams avoid implementing controls on 'trusted' systems, while threat actors specifically target these outdated, under-protected assets.",
    "impact": "Organizations with legacy attachment experience extended support contracts for systems past vendor security lifecycle, special exemptions for legacy systems in security policies, and delayed or avoided system replacement projects despite budget availability. Historical incidents include the 2017 WannaCry ransomware that specifically targeted Windows XP systems organizations kept operational past Microsoft's support end, and industrial control systems kept operational despite security vulnerabilities due to operational attachment.",
    "psychological_basis": "Attachment to legacy systems represents a complex psychological phenomenon rooted in object relations theory and transitional object concepts. The core mechanism involves the formation of emotional bonds with technological systems that transcend their functional utility, creating a psychological dependency that mirrors early attachment patterns described by Bowlby (1969). Winnicott (1971) described how legacy systems function as organizational transitional objects - neither purely functional tools nor purely symbolic representations, but existing in a psychological space that provides comfort and security. The attachment process involves familiarity bias (known systems feel safer regardless of objective security posture), loss aversion (the psychological pain of losing familiar systems outweighs potential gains from upgrades with a 2-3x psychological cost differential per Kahneman & Tversky 1979), and identity integration (the legacy system becomes part of organizational or personal identity). fMRI studies show familiar technologies activate reward pathways in the brain similar to social attachment bonds, with the amygdala showing reduced threat response to familiar systems even when objective security risks are present."
