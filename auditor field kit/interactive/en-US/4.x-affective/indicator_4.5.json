  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to concealment of security incidents or vulnerabilities due to shame and fear of judgment, leading to delayed response and increased damage",
    "context": "Shame-based security hiding occurs when employees conceal security incidents, errors, or concerns due to fear of judgment or career consequences. Unlike simple negligence, this involves active concealment driven by feelings of personal inadequacy. This creates critical vulnerabilities because security incidents remain unreported, allowing attacks to progress undetected while preventing organizational learning from failures. Organizations with blame-focused cultures inadvertently incentivize this behavior, making it a systemic rather than individual problem.",
    "impact": "Organizations experiencing shame-based hiding suffer critical delays in incident reporting, incomplete information disclosure that compromises response measures, and insider threat amplification as employees with hidden errors become susceptible to coercion. Historical incidents include healthcare data breaches where medical professionals delayed reporting due to licensing fears, financial services cases where traders attempted independent resolution of social engineering attacks rather than report to compliance teams, and critical infrastructure operators who made unauthorized fixes to avoid career impact. These patterns systematically undermine SIEM effectiveness, forensic investigations, vulnerability management, and backup recovery confidence.",
    "psychological_basis": "Shame-based hiding emerges from Klein's object relations theory where security incidents trigger splitting mechanisms that prevent individuals from integrating that competent people make mistakes, instead experiencing themselves as wholly inadequate. Bowlby's attachment theory demonstrates that individuals with insecure attachment styles, particularly anxious attachment, interpret security failures as confirmation of fundamental inadequacy. Neuroscience research shows shame activates the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, creating social pain neurologically equivalent to physical pain, explaining the powerful motivation to avoid shame-inducing situations. Edmondson's research on psychological safety demonstrates that blame cultures create conditions where shame-based hiding becomes adaptive from an individual perspective while being organizationally destructive."
