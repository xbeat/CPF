  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to inappropriate emotional trust relationships with technology systems based on human relationship patterns rather than rational risk assessment",
    "context": "Trust transference to systems occurs when employees unconsciously treat technology systems as if they possess human-like judgment and reliability, leading to reduced verification behaviors and over-reliance on automated outputs. This psychological mechanism creates cybersecurity vulnerabilities because users bypass normal verification procedures when interacting with 'trusted' systems, making them susceptible to system impersonation attacks, malicious automation, and compromised infrastructure. Organizations experience this as employees approving system-generated requests without verification, accepting AI recommendations without validation, and maintaining confidence in systems even after documented failures.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high system trust transference experience successful system impersonation attacks, compromised automation exploitation, and trust in poisoned AI models. Historical incidents include the Target 2013 breach where trust in vendor systems allowed lateral movement, the SolarWinds attack exploiting trust in software update mechanisms across thousands of organizations, and Business Email Compromise attacks succeeding through trust transfer from email systems to message content. Fake antivirus campaigns and DNS poisoning attacks exploit system-based trust to deliver malicious payloads through interfaces users perceive as inherently trustworthy.",
    "psychological_basis": "Trust transference to systems represents a fundamental object relations mechanism where individuals project attachment patterns and relational trust onto technological systems. Klein's object relations theory explains how early attachment patterns create templates for all future relationships, including relationships with non-human objects. Winnicott's transitional space concept demonstrates how individuals use objects to bridge internal and external reality, applicable to digital environments. Bowlby's attachment theory reveals how security-seeking behaviors transfer to substitute attachment figures, including technological systems. Mirror neuron activation shows brain systems designed for human interaction activate when engaging with anthropomorphized technology, and oxytocin release demonstrates social bonding neurochemicals can be triggered by technology interactions that feel interpersonal."
