  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to excessive security behaviors driven by guilt, leading to inefficient resource allocation, attention depletion, and security theater",
    "context": "Guilt-driven overcompliance occurs when employees follow security rules so rigidly that they miss actual threats or create operational bottlenecks. These individuals become so focused on perfect rule-following that they exhaust their attention resources, making them vulnerable to social engineering attacks that exploit their need to prove compliance. This creates a paradox where excessive security consciousness becomes a security risk itself through attention resource depletion, process overload, and procedural rigidity that prevents adaptive threat response.",
    "impact": "Organizations with guilt-driven overcompliance experience security theater where visible compliance measures exceed effective security outcomes, attention resource exhaustion leading to missed actual threats, and incident response paralysis while seeking proper authorization. Historical incidents include Target 2013 where excessive focus on PCI compliance procedures created blind spots to lateral movement, Anthem 2015 where over-reliance on compliance checklists prevented adaptive security responses, and Equifax 2017 where guilt about deviating from established protocols prevented timely patch management despite known vulnerabilities.",
    "psychological_basis": "Guilt-driven overcompliance represents a maladaptive response to internalized authority operating through Klein's paranoid-schizoid position where individuals split the world into 'perfectly compliant' versus 'security violator.' The individual experiences persistent guilt about potential security failures, leading to compulsive adherence regardless of context or actual risk. This emerges from an internalized punitive superego demanding perfect compliance as protection against imagined catastrophic consequences. Bowlby's attachment theory explains anxious attachment patterns creating hypervigilance toward authority and rules. Neurological studies show heightened error-related negativity (ERN) responses in guilt-prone individuals, indicating excessive error monitoring that depletes cognitive resources needed for actual threat detection."
