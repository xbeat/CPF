  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to emotional states spreading through organizational networks, amplifying individual emotional vulnerabilities and causing cascading security decision failures",
    "context": "Emotional contagion represents the unconscious and automatic mimicry of emotional states between individuals in proximity, occurring through multiple channels including facial expressions, vocal tones, body postures, and physiological synchronization. In cybersecurity contexts, this phenomenon creates cascading vulnerabilities where negative emotional states (anxiety, panic, anger, despair) or positive but dangerous states (overconfidence, euphoria) spread rapidly through organizational networks, compromising collective security decision-making. Within the CPF's Affective Vulnerabilities category, emotional contagion serves as a multiplier effect that amplifies other affective vulnerabilities, creating systemic rather than isolated security risks.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high emotional contagion vulnerability experience security incidents where one person's anxiety triggers cascades of rushed decisions, bypassed procedures, and collective poor judgment. During the 2008 Financial Crisis, attackers exploited widespread organizational anxiety and layoff fears to increase phishing success rates. COVID-19 pandemic saw threat actors leverage collective anxiety about health and economic stability to bypass normal security skepticism. Modern ransomware operations deliberately create time pressure and emotional chaos to prevent calm, strategic response, exploiting how stress levels synchronize within incident response teams, leading to groupthink and tunnel vision during critical events.",
    "psychological_basis": "Hatfield, Cacioppo, and Rapson's (1994) seminal work on emotional contagion established three-stage process: mimicry leads to convergence leads to contagion. Mirror neuron research (Rizzolatti & Craighero, 2004) demonstrates neurological basis for automatic emotional mimicry, with limbic system activation spreading through visual and auditory emotional cues before conscious processing. Barsade's (2002) experimental studies demonstrated measurable emotional contagion in business teams affecting cooperation and conflict. Sy, Côté, and Saavedra (2005) showed leader emotional states spread to team members within minutes. Klein's (1946) object relations framework explains how organizations split emotions into 'good' (calm, controlled) and 'bad' (anxious, angry), leading to projection of anxiety onto external threats while denying internal emotional chaos."
