    "short": "Measures vulnerability to reduced security vigilance and maintenance behaviors due to depression-induced apathy, cognitive impairment, and systematic degradation of cybersecurity compliance",
    "context": "Depression-related negligence occurs when work-related stress, burnout, or personal challenges reduce employees' cognitive capacity and motivation to maintain cybersecurity vigilance. This creates systematic vulnerabilities as affected individuals become more susceptible to phishing, neglect password hygiene, delay security updates, and avoid reporting incidents. Organizations with high-stress environments, inadequate mental health support, or blame-focused cultures are particularly vulnerable to this pattern.",
    "impact": "Organizations experiencing depression-related negligence suffer from increased phishing susceptibility through emotional manipulation attacks, password hygiene degradation through cognitive effort avoidance, delayed incident reporting due to shame and fear, endpoint security degradation through avoidance behaviors, and potential insider threat materialization. Correlations emerge from aggregated incident analysis showing increased security incidents during high-stress periods correlating with reported depression rates, particularly in healthcare sector during pandemic response, financial services correlating with employee assistance program utilization, and technology sector patterns following layoffs and organizational restructuring.",
    "psychological_basis": "Depression-related negligence emerges from multiple interconnected psychological mechanisms: cognitive dysfunction where depression impairs executive functioning and working memory with reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation; anhedonia and motivation deficit where loss of interest in activities extends to security protocol compliance; Seligman's learned helplessness model creating generalized expectancies of uncontrollability manifesting as 'why bother?' attitudes toward security measures; and cognitive load amplification where depression reduces available cognitive resources through rumination leaving insufficient mental capacity for security awareness. Neurocognitive studies demonstrate depression disrupts default mode network and executive control networks essential for sustained attention and risk assessment, with anterior cingulate cortex showing reduced activation impairing error monitoring and conflict detection."
