  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to increased risk-taking behaviors driven by anger and frustration with security tools, policies, or procedures",
    "context": "Anger-induced risk taking occurs when workplace frustration with security tools, policies, or procedures leads employees to bypass security controls or make risky decisions. When people are angry or frustrated, they prioritize immediate goal achievement over security considerations, creating vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. This manifests as password sharing during system outages, clicking suspicious links when desperate for solutions, or adopting unauthorized tools to work around perceived obstacles.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high employee anger scores show 340% higher rates of insider incidents, 220% higher phishing success rates during periods of organizational stress, and security policy violations that cluster around system changes and new security implementations. Historical patterns include the Target 2013 breach where HVAC contractor credential theft was facilitated by frustration with complex authentication requirements, Anthem 2015 where social engineering succeeded partly because employees were frustrated with new security procedures, and Equifax 2017 where patch management failures were exacerbated by IT team conflicts and resistance to security mandates.",
    "psychological_basis": "Anger-induced risk taking represents a fundamental vulnerability where emotional arousal systematically impairs cognitive risk assessment. The limbic system (particularly the amygdala) becomes hyperactivated while prefrontal cortex executive control is suppressed. This neurobiological response creates a state where immediate emotional discharge takes precedence over careful evaluation of consequences. Anger triggers norepinephrine and dopamine release, creating heightened arousal that narrows attention and reduces cognitive flexibility. The anterior cingulate cortex shows decreased activation during angry states, impairing the ability to recognize security risks. Kahneman's dual-process theory explains how emotional arousal shifts decision-making from careful System 2 analysis to impulsive System 1 responses. Prospect theory demonstrates that anger increases preference for risky gains and reduces loss aversion. Klein's concept of splitting explains how anger creates 'all bad' attributions to security measures, perceived as purely obstructive rather than protective."
