  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to increased error rates in security procedures due to anxiety-induced cognitive impairment during high-stress periods",
    "context": "Anxiety-triggered mistakes occur when stress and time pressure overwhelm employees' ability to follow security protocols correctly. Under anxiety, people make rushed decisions, skip verification steps, and fall back on unsafe shortcuts. This psychological state is actively exploited by attackers who create artificial urgency and pressure to bypass normal security thinking. Organizations with high-stress environments or poor anxiety management see significantly higher rates of security incidents during deadline periods, organizational changes, and crisis situations.",
    "impact": "Organizations experiencing anxiety-triggered mistakes show clear patterns of increased security incidents during stressful periods, deadline-driven security protocol shortcuts, and incident response cascade failures where stress compounds initial errors. Historical incidents include CEO fraud attacks during system outages where stressed employees bypass verification procedures, social engineering during organizational restructuring exploiting employee anxiety about job security, and ransomware incidents where anxious IT staff make hasty decisions that compound problems. Multiple incidents demonstrate security teams delaying response due to anxiety about making wrong decisions.",
    "psychological_basis": "Anxiety-triggered mistakes emerge from neurobiological disruption where amygdala activation triggers stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) that impair prefrontal cortex functioning. The 300-500ms delay between unconscious processing and conscious awareness means anxiety responses influence behavior before rational security protocols can be engaged. Cognitive resource depletion occurs as anxiety consumes working memory capacity (Miller's 'magical number seven' limitation), leaving insufficient cognitive resources for complex security tasks. Research from LeDoux (2000) demonstrates amygdala activation occurs before prefrontal cortex engagement. Kahneman (2011) shows System 1 (fast, automatic) processing dominates under anxiety while System 2 (deliberate, security-conscious) processing is impaired. Bowlby's attachment theory reveals that anxious attachment styles correlate with heightened sensitivity to authority figures, making individuals more susceptible to social engineering during anxious states."
