    "short": "Detects organizational proximity to irreversible phase transitions where small additional stressors trigger sudden, cascading security failures rather than gradual degradation",
    "context": "Tipping point vulnerabilities occur when organizational systems reach critical thresholds where small additional stressors trigger sudden, cascading security failures rather than gradual degradation. Unlike predictable system overload, these vulnerabilities create cliff-edge effects where normal operations suddenly collapse into crisis mode, bypassing established security protocols. Organizations with these vulnerabilities appear stable until a critical threshold is exceeded, then experience rapid, widespread security breakdown that attackers can exploit during the confusion and decision-making paralysis that follows.",
    "impact": "Organizations near tipping points experience coordinated multi-vector attacks during stress convergence, authority cascade exploitation when decision-makers become unavailable, alert fatigue manipulation pushing teams beyond processing threshold, and crisis convergence attacks deliberately timed to organizational transitions. Historical examples include Target 2013 (multiple stress factors reached tipping point enabling months of undetected exfiltration), Equifax 2017 (accumulated technical debt reached threshold where normal governance failed), SolarWinds 2020 (trusted system compromise created rapid trust-to-distrust tipping point), and Colonial Pipeline 2021 (OT/IT confusion reached critical threshold triggering infrastructure cascade).",
    "psychological_basis": "Chaos Theory (Lorenz) demonstrates sensitive dependence on initial conditions where minor perturbations trigger massive system changes. Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) shows cognitive systems have finite capacity before performance cliff effects occur. Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky) reveals loss aversion intensifies under uncertainty creating psychological feedback loops. Bion's Group Dynamics shows groups rapidly shift between functional work modes and dysfunctional basic assumption modes when anxiety reaches critical thresholds. Perrow's Normal Accidents Theory demonstrates complex, tightly-coupled systems inevitably produce unexpected failures through interactive complexity."
