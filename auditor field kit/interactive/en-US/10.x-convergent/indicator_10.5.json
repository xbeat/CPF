    "short": "Detects organizational inability to recognize, prepare for, or respond to high-impact, unprecedented cyber threats outside existing mental models",
    "context": "Black swan blindness is the organizational inability to recognize, prepare for, or respond to high-impact, unprecedented cyber threats. Organizations become trapped by their own experience and create dangerous blind spots by focusing only on likely threats while ignoring extreme but possible scenarios. This vulnerability enables attackers to exploit completely novel attack vectors that fall outside existing security models, detection systems, and response playbooks.",
    "impact": "Organizations with black swan blindness experience supply chain weaponization through trusted vendor compromises, AI-generated novel attacks that bypass signature-based detection, cascading infrastructure failures through unmapped dependencies, and insider-external hybrid attacks that don't fit threat categories. Historical examples include NotPetya 2017 (nation-state destructive attack disguised as ransomware), SolarWinds 2020 (supply chain compromise affecting 18,000 organizations), Colonial Pipeline 2021 (ransomware causing nationwide fuel shortage), and Target 2013 (HVAC compromise spreading to payment systems).",
    "psychological_basis": "Taleb's Black Swan Theory (2007) - events with three characteristics: unpredictability, massive impact, and retrospective predictability. Kahneman & Tversky's Prospect Theory (1979) - systematic errors in probability estimation, particularly underweighting extreme low-probability events. Narrative Fallacy - constructing coherent stories from incomplete information leading to false confidence in predictions. Confirmation Bias Cascades - information challenging existing mental models systematically filtered out."
