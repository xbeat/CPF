    "short": "Identifies critical organizational states where system complexity overwhelms cognitive capacity, triggering catastrophic decision-making failures and dangerous security shortcuts",
    "context": "Complexity catastrophe represents a phase transition where organizational cognitive capacity becomes overwhelmed by system complexity beyond the 'magical number seven' limitation of working memory. This creates cognitive overflow cascades where individuals resort to dangerous simplification heuristics, abandon security protocols deemed 'too complex,' and delegate critical decisions to systems without proper oversight.",
    "impact": "Organizations experiencing complexity catastrophe suffer attacks exploiting unmanaged complexity: Target 2013 breach (complex vendor networks created unmonitored pathways), Equifax 2017 (patch management complexity led to critical updates being missed), SolarWinds 2020 (complex software supply chain obscured malicious code). Common patterns include security tool sprawl creating blind spots, network topologies becoming unmappable, and alert fatigue from exponentially increasing complexity.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cognitive Load Theory (Miller, 1956; Sweller, 1988) - human working memory limited to 7±2 chunks, performance degrades exponentially beyond this. Systems Theory (Perrow, 1984) - Normal Accidents occur when system complexity exceeds human management capacity. Chaos Theory (Gleick, 1987) - organizations near edge of chaos become hypersensitive to minor perturbations. Neuroscience (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982) - prefrontal cortex shows measurable stress responses to excessive complexity."
