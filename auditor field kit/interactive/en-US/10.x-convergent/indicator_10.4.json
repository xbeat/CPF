    "short": "Detects dangerous alignments of vulnerabilities across multiple security layers creating clear attack pathways through systemic blindness",
    "context": "Swiss cheese alignment occurs when vulnerabilities across multiple security layers (network, endpoint, application, physical) align simultaneously, creating clear attack pathways. Organizations fail to detect these dangerous alignments because security teams manage each layer independently without coordinating vulnerability assessments. This systemic blindness enables sophisticated attacks that bypass multiple defenses by exploiting the gaps between security silos.",
    "impact": "Organizations with Swiss cheese alignment vulnerabilities experience APT breaches exploiting multi-layer gaps, insider threats leveraging system knowledge to bypass coordinated defenses, supply chain attacks creating simultaneous vulnerabilities across procurement and technical controls, and social engineering campaigns coordinating human and technical exploitation. Historical examples include Target 2013 (vendor access, network segmentation, and monitoring failures aligned), SolarWinds 2020 (supply chain, code signing, and monitoring vulnerabilities aligned), and Equifax 2017 (patch management, network segmentation, and monitoring gaps aligned).",
    "psychological_basis": "Reason's Swiss Cheese Model (1990) - organizational accidents occur through alignment of latent failures across defensive barriers. Cognitive Load Theory (Miller, 1956) - working memory limitation to 7±2 items prevents tracking vulnerability states across layers. Systems Thinking Research (Senge, 1990) - humans think linearly not systemically, missing emergent patterns. Mental Model Fragmentation - security personnel conceptualize each layer in isolation rather than as integrated system."
