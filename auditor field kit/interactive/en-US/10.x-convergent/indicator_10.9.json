    "short": "Identifies failure to recognize and manage interdependencies between security domains, creating cascading vulnerabilities when coupled systems interact unexpectedly",
    "context": "System coupling failures represent psychological inability to recognize and manage interdependencies between seemingly separate security domains. This vulnerability emerges from cognitive compartmentalization - the mental tendency to treat interconnected systems as isolated entities - serving a defensive function by reducing cognitive load but creating dangerous blind spots where vulnerabilities cascade through coupled systems.",
    "impact": "Organizations with unmanaged coupling suffer cascading failures: NotPetya 2017 (legitimate system coupling became attack vector spreading globally), Target 2013 (HVAC vendor coupling to payment systems), SolarWinds 2020 (trusted software update coupling amplified supply chain attack), Colonial Pipeline 2021 (IT/OT coupling enabled ransomware to disrupt physical infrastructure). Common patterns include lateral movement through unexpected pathways, cascade failures propagating across domains, and insider threats amplified through excessive coupling.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cognitive Compartmentalization - mental tendency to treat interconnected systems as isolated. Systems Theory (Perrow, 1984) - tightly coupled systems create unavoidable failure modes. Cognitive Load Theory (Miller, 1956) - limited working memory prevents comprehensive mental modeling of complex interconnections. Bion's Basic Assumptions (1961) - psychological defenses obscure system interdependencies. Neuroscience (Buckner et al., 2008) - brain's default mode toward simplified linear thinking."
