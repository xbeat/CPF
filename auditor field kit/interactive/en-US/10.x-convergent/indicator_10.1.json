    "short": "Detects catastrophic convergence of multiple psychological vulnerabilities that create systemic security failures beyond the sum of individual parts",
    "context": "Perfect storm conditions occur when multiple organizational stressors converge simultaneously, overwhelming normal security decision-making processes and creating cascading failures. Organizations experiencing perfect storms become highly susceptible to coordinated cyber attacks because their normal security processes become unreliable or abandoned entirely.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high vulnerability experience coordinated multi-vector attacks during crisis periods, insider threat exploitation during organizational transitions, supply chain compromises during vendor crises, and ransomware attacks during mergers or leadership changes. Historical examples include Target 2013 breach (holiday season + vendor chaos + new POS deployment), Equifax 2017 (patch failure + leadership vacuum + regulatory pressure), Colonial Pipeline 2021 (weekend + remote work stress + OT/IT confusion), and SolarWinds 2020 (COVID-19 stress + remote work + accelerated digital transformation).",
    "psychological_basis": "Systems theory (Von Bertalanffy, 1968) - emergent properties from component interactions. Normal Accident Theory (Perrow, 1984) - complex systems experience inevitable accidents from unexpected failure interactions. Complexity Theory (Holland, 1995) - phase transitions where quantitative stress becomes qualitative breakdown. Bion's Group Dynamics (1961) - perfect storms trigger simultaneous activation of dependency, fight-flight, and pairing, creating chaotic organizational behavior."
