    "short": "Identifies organizational security states exhibiting path-dependent memory effects where current security posture depends on historical sequence of events rather than current threats",
    "context": "Hysteresis security gaps represent critical system-level vulnerability where organizational security states exhibit path-dependent memory effects - current security posture depends not only on present conditions but on historical sequence of security events and responses. This manifests as organizational 'stickiness' where security behaviors, policies, and threat perceptions remain anchored to past states despite changed circumstances.",
    "impact": "Organizations with hysteresis gaps maintain outdated security approaches: continued perimeter defense focus after cloud migration, password complexity requirements despite counterproductivity evidence, legacy system persistence despite known vulnerabilities, regulatory compliance frameworks reflecting historical rather than current threats. These create exploitable gaps where attackers leverage knowledge of historical security patterns to predict and bypass current defenses.",
    "psychological_basis": "Historical State Dependency - organizations develop security postures reflecting past threat landscapes rather than current realities. Institutional Memory Loops (Weick, 1995) - previous security decisions become templates for future actions regardless of environmental changes. Cognitive Path Dependence - decision-makers unconsciously weight historical security experiences more heavily than current threat intelligence. Sunk Cost Fallacy - emotional attachment to historical security investments prevents adaptation."
