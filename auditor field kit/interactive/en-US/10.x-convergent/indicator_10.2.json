    "short": "Detects psychological conditions where isolated security incidents spread throughout organizations like wildfire through stress contagion, communication breakdown, and decision-making degradation",
    "context": "Cascade failure triggers occur when organizational stress causes isolated security incidents to propagate across departments through psychological contagion. When one person or team becomes overwhelmed during a crisis, their panic, poor decisions, or communication breakdown creates a domino effect that disables security controls across multiple departments. This psychological contagion transforms minor incidents into major breaches because stressed employees bypass procedures, make configuration errors, and fail to coordinate responses effectively.",
    "impact": "Organizations experiencing cascade failures face multi-vector attacks during operational stress, social engineering campaigns during legitimate crisis periods, insider threat amplification during organizational turmoil, and supply chain attacks via vendor crisis exploitation. Historical examples include Target 2013 (holiday stress + vendor chaos + POS deployment enabled both HVAC compromise and data exfiltration), Equifax 2017 (vulnerability + organizational dysfunction + discovery panic triggered contradictory decisions), and COVID-19 remote work transition (IT overwhelm + expanded attack surface + employee anxiety created widespread security blind spots).",
    "psychological_basis": "Emotional Contagion Studies (Hatfield et al., 1994) demonstrate emotions spread automatically through organizations within minutes. Stress Contagion Research (Westman, 2001) shows stress transfers between individuals through multiple mechanisms. Mirror Neuron Systems enable automatic replication of observed stress behaviors. Limbic Resonance (Lewis et al., 2000) shows emotional brain states synchronize between individuals. Bion's Basic Assumptions (1961) reveal groups under stress revert to primitive psychological defenses that cascade through organizational networks."
