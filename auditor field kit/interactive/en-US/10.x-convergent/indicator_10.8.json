    "short": "Detects organizational failure to comprehend how complex systems produce unexpected security failures through interaction of seemingly unrelated components",
    "context": "Emergence unpredictability represents a psychological vulnerability where individuals and organizations fail to recognize that complex systems can produce emergent behaviors that cannot be predicted from understanding individual components. This stems from fundamental cognitive limitations including linearity bias, reductionist thinking, and illusion of control when confronted with complex, interconnected systems.",
    "impact": "Organizations blind to emergent threats suffer attacks exploiting combinations of minor weaknesses: NotPetya 2017 (emergent propagation through multiple vectors despite EternalBlue patches), SolarWinds 2020 (supply chain compromise producing emergent attack surface no organization could predict from local security model). These incidents share common patterns: unexpected system interactions, non-proportional cause-effect relationships, and defender surprise despite sophisticated security controls.",
    "psychological_basis": "Systems Theory (Bertalanffy, 1968) - complex systems exhibit emergent properties unpredictable from components alone. Complexity Science (Holland, 1995) - adaptive systems produce emergent behaviors through non-linear interactions. Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) - humans systematically misjudge probabilities for novel scenarios. Neuroscience (Bar, 2007) - brain's predictive coding fails when encountering truly emergent phenomena."
