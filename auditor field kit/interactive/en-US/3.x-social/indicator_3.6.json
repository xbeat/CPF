    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who exploit shared identity markers (alma mater, industry, profession, culture) to establish in-group trust and bypass security protocols",
    "context": "When individuals encounter shared identity signals (shared profession, alma mater, industry affiliation, cultural background), the medial prefrontal cortex processes in-group members as self-extensions, creating automatic trust within 200-400ms. Attackers exploit unity by mimicking professional credentials, educational backgrounds, or cultural markers to trigger in-group favoritism and security compliance.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience successful professional identity phishing (67% success rate vs. 23% baseline), departmental impersonation breaches, alumni-based social engineering, and credential sharing within perceived in-groups. Unity exploitation often bypasses skepticism that would apply to obvious outsiders.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cialdini's Unity Principle (2016) - the 7th and most powerful principle of influence. Unity transcends similarity (likability) by establishing shared identity. Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) demonstrates in-group favoritism creates preferential treatment, trust, and cooperation. Neurologically, medial prefrontal cortex activates when processing in-group members as extensions of self, making unity the deepest form of social influence."
