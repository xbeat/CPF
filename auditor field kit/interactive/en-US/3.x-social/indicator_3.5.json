    "short": "Measures vulnerability to decision-making errors triggered by artificial scarcity, limited-time offers, and resource pressure that bypass rational security judgment",
    "context": "When humans perceive scarcity—whether of time, resources, or opportunities—cognitive capacity diminishes by the equivalent of 13 IQ points (Mani et al., 2013). This tunneling effect causes individuals to focus narrowly on the scarce resource while neglecting security considerations, creating exploitable pre-cognitive vulnerabilities through limited-time phishing, fake opportunity scams, and deadline-driven bypass requests.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high scarcity susceptibility experience successful deadline-pressure social engineering, limited-offer fraud, and resource-competition attacks. Employees under perceived scarcity make impulsive decisions, skip verification procedures, and comply with urgent requests without security assessment. Loss aversion amplifies impact by 2.5x—people work harder to avoid losses than acquire equivalent gains.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cialdini's Scarcity Principle (2007): Items become more attractive when availability decreases. Shah & Shafir (2012): Scarcity creates attentional tunneling and reduces executive function. Mani et al. (2013): Financial scarcity reduces cognitive capacity by 13-14 IQ points. Kahneman & Tversky (1979): Loss aversion causes losses to be weighted 2.5x more than equivalent gains. Neurologically, scarcity activates anterior cingulate cortex (error detection/urgency), reduces prefrontal cortex activity (rational planning), and triggers amygdala activation (fight-or-flight responses)."
