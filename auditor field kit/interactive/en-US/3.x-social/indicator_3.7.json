    "short": "Measures vulnerability to social conformity pressure where employees compromise security to align with peer behavior or avoid group rejection",
    "context": "When employees observe colleagues bypassing security controls or receive pressure from peers to comply with questionable requests, they often conform to group behavior even when it violates security policy. Asch's conformity experiments demonstrate 75% of subjects conform at least once to obviously incorrect group consensus, creating a pre-cognitive vulnerability attackers exploit through peer-amplified social engineering.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high peer pressure susceptibility experience cascading security violations where one compromised employee influences others to participate in credential sharing, policy violations, or insider threats. Historical incidents include Target 2013 (credential sharing pressure among contractors), Sony 2014 (deadline pressure normalized security bypass), and Anthem 2015 (non-reporting conformity enabled persistent compromise).",
    "psychological_basis": "Asch's conformity studies (1951) - 75% conform at least once to incorrect group consensus. Social Identity Theory (Tajfel, 1979) - group membership drives behavior over individual judgment. Neuroscience reveals social rejection activates dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula - the same regions processing physical pain (Eisenberger, 2003), making peer rejection neurologically equivalent to physical threat."
