  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who exploit social identity threats, professional identity conflicts, and group membership pressures to manipulate security compliance through identity-protective cognition",
    "context": "When employees face threats to their social identity - professional competence, group membership, generational identity, or status position - identity-protective cognition activates defensive responses that attackers exploit. Social identity theory demonstrates that group membership becomes part of self-concept, making identity challenges cognitively equivalent to personal threats, triggering predictable security-compromising behaviors.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience insider threats driven by identity conflicts, professional network exploitation, cultural division attacks, and status-based social engineering. Identity threats activate stronger defensive responses than direct financial incentives, making this vulnerability particularly dangerous for insider risk and social engineering that leverages professional communities.",
    "psychological_basis": "Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) - group memberships become core self-concept components. Identity-protective cognition causes defensive information processing when identity is threatened. Eisenberger et al. (2003) demonstrated social rejection activates same neural pain pathways as physical pain. Cialdini's unity principle shows shared identity creates powerful influence. Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory explains why identity-inconsistent security requests create psychological distress that drives compliance to resolve dissonance."
