    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who exploit reciprocal obligation through gifts, favors, or benefits to manipulate security compliance",
    "context": "When employees receive unsolicited gifts, favors, or benefits, pre-cognitive reciprocity mechanisms activate within 300-500ms, creating obligation pressure that attackers exploit to bypass security controls through quid pro quo schemes, phishing with benefits, and social engineering gifts.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience successful USB drop attacks (45-60% pickup rate), vendor-based breaches, compromised IT support channels, and security policy exceptions following seemingly innocent favors. Reciprocity exploitation often precedes more sophisticated attack chains.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cialdini's reciprocity principle (2007) - Universal human tendency to repay favors. Neurologically, receiving gifts activates ventral striatum and creates measurable obligation pressure. fMRI studies show pre-cognitive activation before conscious awareness, making this vulnerability particularly insidious."
