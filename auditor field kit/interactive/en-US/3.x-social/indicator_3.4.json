    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who exploit rapport, similarity, and liking to bypass security verification and decision-making processes",
    "context": "When employees develop positive rapport with individuals—through perceived similarity, attractiveness, or reciprocal interest—they become more likely to trust and comply with requests, creating a neurochemical vulnerability that attackers exploit through social media reconnaissance, rapport-building techniques, and extended engagement campaigns.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience successful long-term social engineering campaigns, insider threat cultivation, and targeted spear phishing. Research shows 300-400% increased attack success rates when rapport is established before exploitation.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cialdini's Liking Principle (1984) - people say yes to those they like. Neurologically, positive social interactions trigger oxytocin and dopamine release while suppressing amygdala threat detection, creating trust bias that overrides security protocols. Attachment theory explains rapid bonding through similarity and reciprocity."
