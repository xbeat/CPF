    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who exploit employees' concerns about personal or organizational reputation to bypass security controls through shame, status preservation, or public image management",
    "context": "When security incidents, policy violations, or uncomfortable disclosures threaten personal or organizational reputation, threat management neural systems activate, creating defensive behaviors that attackers exploit. Employees prioritize reputation protection (average 2.3x stronger motivation than direct financial gain) over security protocols when facing public embarrassment, career consequences, or organizational status loss.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high reputation management conflict vulnerability experience concealed breaches (average 87-day detection delay vs. 39-day baseline), avoided incident reporting, disabled security monitoring, and compromised threat response. Attackers use reputation pressure to maintain access longer and expand compromise scope while employees suppress defensive actions.",
    "psychological_basis": "Status anxiety and reputation threat activate amygdala and anterior insula, creating defensive decision-making that prioritizes image preservation over rational security analysis. Neuroscientific research shows reputation threats activate same pain centers as physical threats, driving avoidance behaviors. Organizational reputation vulnerability magnified by hierarchical power dynamics and career consequence perception."
