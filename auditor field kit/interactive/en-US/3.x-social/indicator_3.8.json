  "description": {
    "short": "Measures organizational vulnerability to security failures arising from conformity pressure when insecure practices become culturally normalized and embedded in routine operations",
    "context": "When insecure behaviors become organizational norms, employees conform automatically through social proof mechanisms and cultural expectations. Asch's conformity experiments (1951) demonstrated 75% of participants conform to incorrect group consensus. In cybersecurity contexts, normalized practices like password sharing, workaround behaviors, alert dismissal, and delayed patching persist despite policies because 'everyone does it this way.'",
    "impact": "Organizations with high conformity to insecure norms experience institutionalized vulnerabilities immune to technical controls. Shadow IT proliferates because 'that's how we get work done.' Security alerts are ignored because 'they're always false positives.' Credentials are shared because 'we've always done it this way.' Cultural norms override written policies, creating persistent attack surfaces that technical controls cannot remediate.",
    "psychological_basis": "Asch (1951) conformity studies - 75% conform to obviously incorrect group consensus. Schein's organizational culture model (1985) - unconscious basic assumptions drive behavior more powerfully than explicit policies. Sherif's autokinetic effect demonstrates norm formation. Deutsch & Gerard (1955) distinguish normative conformity (acceptance) from informational conformity (uncertainty). Bandura's social learning theory (1977) shows observational learning of security behaviors."
