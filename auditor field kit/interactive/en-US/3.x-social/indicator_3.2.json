    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who exploit commitment/consistency principle to escalate from small initial requests to major security compromises",
    "context": "When organizations make small initial security exceptions or commitments, cognitive dissonance creates psychological pressure to maintain consistency with prior decisions, enabling attackers to progressively escalate access, privileges, or policy violations through foot-in-door techniques and sunk cost exploitation.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience vendor access creep, privilege escalation chains, normalized exception patterns, and inability to reverse poor security decisions due to sunk cost fallacy. Historical incidents include Target 2013 vendor access escalation ($200M+ impact) and progressive BEC campaigns that start small and escalate over weeks.",
    "psychological_basis": "Cialdini's commitment/consistency principle (2007) - humans have deep desire to appear consistent with prior actions. Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory (1957) - psychological discomfort when reversing previous commitments. Staw's escalation of commitment research (1976) - sunk cost fallacy drives continued investment in failing courses. Sharot fMRI studies (2010) show reward pathway activation when maintaining consistency, creating neurological pressure against reversal."
