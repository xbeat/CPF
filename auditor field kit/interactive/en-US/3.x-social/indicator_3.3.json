    "short": "Measures vulnerability to attackers who fabricate apparent consensus, industry standards, or peer adoption to influence security decisions",
    "context": "When employees observe what they believe to be widespread adoption, industry standards, or peer behavior, they often align their actions without independent verification, creating a pre-cognitive vulnerability that attackers exploit through fake industry standards, fabricated customer testimonials, and false consensus claims.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience supply chain compromises, adoption of malicious technologies presented as 'industry standard', and bypassed security controls based on fabricated peer pressure. Historical incidents include the SolarWinds Orion compromise affecting 18,000 organizations and COVID-19 remote work exploitation campaigns.",
    "psychological_basis": "Asch conformity experiments (1951) - 75% of subjects conformed to incorrect group consensus at least once. Neurologically, social proof activates the ventral striatum (reward pathway) and reduces independent critical analysis. Cialdini's social proof principle demonstrates humans use others' behavior as heuristic for correct action, especially under uncertainty."
