    "context": "Algorithmic Fairness Blindness represents a complex psychological vulnerability where individuals and organizations develop systematic blind spots to biased or discriminatory outputs from AI systems. This phenomenon emerges from trust transfer to authority where individuals assume AI possesses inherent objectivity, system justification bias extending to defending algorithmic decisions, and automation bias preventing critical evaluation of AI outputs. This creates security vulnerabilities because biased AI systems create exploitable patterns - attackers can predict which populations will be under-monitored, which alerts will be deprioritized, and which security gaps exist, enabling discriminatory social engineering, insider threat exploitation through monitoring blind spots, AI poisoning attacks, and regulatory compliance failures.",
