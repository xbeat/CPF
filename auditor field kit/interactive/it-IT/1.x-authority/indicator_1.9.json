  "description": {
    "short": "Measures vulnerability to compliance cascades where employees observe colleagues deferring to authority figures and use this as justification for their own compliance, creating compound psychological pressure",
    "context": "Authority-based social proof occurs when employees observe colleagues complying with apparent authority figures and use this as justification for their own compliance, creating a compound vulnerability. This psychological mechanism makes organizations particularly susceptible to CEO fraud, vendor impersonation, and policy bypass attacks because employees see 'everyone else is doing it' combined with 'the boss said so.' The result is reduced verification behaviors and faster spread of security incidents through organizations.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high susceptibility experience compliance cascades where initial authority-approved exceptions become normalized across teams, CEO fraud attacks with 90% higher success rates when attackers reference other employees, and policy erosion through 'precedent' rather than formal changes. Business Email Compromise incidents show 300% effectiveness increase when combining authority and social proof claims, with financial losses averaging 40% higher than authority-only attacks.",
    "psychological_basis": "This convergent vulnerability combines Milgram's authority obedience research (65% baseline compliance, increasing to 92% when participants observe confederates obeying first) with Cialdini's social proof mechanisms. fMRI studies show reduced prefrontal cortex activation when following both authority and social cues simultaneously. The dual-processing nature means System 1 (automatic) responses dominate when both influence types align, creating self-reinforcing cycles where each act of observed compliance increases likelihood of further compliance."
