    "short": "Measures vulnerability to automatically granting elevated privileges or bypassing security protocols during crises based solely on authority claims, without proper verification",
    "context": "Crisis Authority Escalation occurs when employees automatically grant elevated privileges or bypass security protocols during high-stress situations based solely on authority claims, without proper verification. During crises, people seek quick decisions from authority figures and skip normal security checks due to time pressure and stress. This creates a prime opportunity for attackers to impersonate executives or IT leaders during emergencies to gain unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data.",
    "impact": "Organizations with high crisis authority vulnerability experience successful business email compromise during emergencies, unauthorized break-glass access exploitation, fraudulent emergency IT support attacks, and regulatory impersonation during compliance crises. Attackers specifically time attacks to coincide with legitimate organizational crises or manufacture crisis conditions to activate this vulnerability.",
    "psychological_basis": "During crisis conditions, cognitive resources become severely limited, forcing individuals to rely on System 1 (fast, automatic) rather than System 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking. Crisis states activate the amygdala's threat response system, flooding the brain with stress hormones that impair prefrontal cortex functioning. This neurochemical cascade creates hypervigilance to authority cues while simultaneously losing capacity for critical analysis. Milgram's obedience studies (1974) showed that compliance with authority increases dramatically under crisis conditions as individuals seek external structure to manage overwhelming uncertainty."
