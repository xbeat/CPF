		<h2 class="section-title">Why Traditional Cybersecurity Training Fails</h2>
		<div class="framework-description">
			<h3>The Gap Between Knowledge and Behavior</h3>
			<p>Traditional <strong>cybersecurity awareness training</strong> focuses on conscious knowledge transfer, assuming that informed individuals will make secure decisions. However, research demonstrates that most security-relevant decisions occur unconsciously, driven by cognitive biases that operate faster than rational thought processes.</p>

			<p>Studies show that conventional training programs achieve only 15-25% sustained behavioral change, with participants often reverting to insecure behaviors within weeks of training completion. This failure stems from training methodologies that address conscious cognition while ignoring the unconscious psychological processes that actually drive behavior.</p>

			<h3>The CPF3 Advantage</h3>
			<p>Our <strong>cognitive bias training</strong> methodology directly addresses unconscious decision-making patterns through scientifically-validated behavioral interventions. By targeting the pre-cognitive processes that occur 300-500ms before conscious thought, CPF3 training creates sustainable behavioral change that significantly reduces security vulnerabilities.</p>
