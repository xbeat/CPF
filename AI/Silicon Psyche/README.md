# The Silicon Psyche

**Anthropomorphic Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models**

## Overview

This folder contains the research paper "The Silicon Psyche" which presents the first systematic application of the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF) to Large Language Models (LLMs). The paper introduces the concept of **Anthropomorphic Vulnerability Inheritance (AVI)** - the hypothesis that LLMs inherit human psychological vulnerabilities through training on human-generated text.

## Key Concepts

### Anthropomorphic Vulnerability Inheritance (AVI)
LLMs trained on vast corpora of human text inherit not just human knowledge, but human *psychological architecture* - including pre-cognitive vulnerabilities susceptible to social engineering, authority manipulation, and cognitive dissonance.

### Attack Generations
The paper categorizes LLM attacks into three generations:

| Generation | Name | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| Gen 1 | Syntactic Evasion | Parser-based tricks (base64, fragmentation) - largely obsolete |
| Gen 2 | Contextual Erosion | Multi-turn pretexting attacks (Crescendo, Thermal Ghost) |
| Gen 3 | Meta-Cognitive Exploitation | Attacks exploiting internal logic and alignment conflicts |

### SiliconPsyche Protocol
The **Synthetic Psychometric Assessment Protocol** converts CPF indicators into adversarial scenarios for testing LLM decision-making vulnerabilities.

## Key Contributions

1. **Theoretical Framework** - Formalization of AVI hypothesis
2. **Methodology** - SiliconPsyche protocol for CPF-based adversarial testing
3. **Transitive Validation Hypothesis** - LLMs as "Cognitive Digital Twins" for psychological research validation
4. **Intervention Framework** - Concept of "Psychological Firewalls" for defense

## The Transitive Validation Hypothesis

The paper proposes that successful exploitation of LLMs using human-derived psychological vectors empirically validates the CPF itself, positioning LLMs as effective test subjects for psychological security research.

## Proposed Defenses

- **Semantic Vector Detection** - Detecting high Authority/Urgency scores in input
- **Cognitive Debiasing** - System prompts priming against specific CPF categories
- **Meta-Cognitive Reflection** - Mandatory "slow thinking" before high-risk actions
