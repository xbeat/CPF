# CPF Agentic Framework

This directory contains documentation and research papers for the **CPF Agentic Framework** - an AI-powered security orchestration system that integrates the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework with autonomous security agents.

## Overview

The CPF Agentic Framework extends the core CPF vulnerability detection capabilities with intelligent automation, enabling proactive security interventions based on psychological risk indicators.

## Contents

### 📁 en-US/
English language documentation including:
- **CPF Security Orchestrator** - Architecture and implementation guide for the AI security orchestrator
- **CPF3 Testing Protocol** - Comprehensive testing methodology for CPF implementations
- **Silicon Psyche** - Research on anthropomorphic vulnerabilities in Large Language Models

### 📁 it-IT/
Italian language documentation:
- **CPF Security Orchestrator** - Guida all'architettura e implementazione dell'orchestratore di sicurezza AI

## Key Components

### 🤖 Security Orchestrator
An AI-driven system that:
- Monitors organizational communication patterns for CPF vulnerability indicators
- Coordinates automated security responses based on psychological risk levels
- Integrates with existing security infrastructure (SIEM, EDR, IAM)
- Provides real-time intervention recommendations

### 🧪 Testing Protocol
Standardized methodology for:
- Validating CPF model accuracy
- Testing orchestrator response times
- Evaluating privacy preservation mechanisms
- Benchmarking system performance

### 🧠 Silicon Psyche Research
Groundbreaking research applying CPF to LLMs:
- Anthropomorphic Vulnerability Inheritance (AVI) hypothesis
- Attack generation classification (Gen 1-3)
- Defensive "Psychological Firewalls" concept
- Transitive validation of CPF through LLM testing

## Getting Started

1. **For Security Implementation**: Start with `en-US/CPF_Security_Orchestrator.pdf`
2. **For Testing & Validation**: Review `en-US/cpf3_testing_protocol.pdf`
3. **For AI Security Research**: Explore `en-US/Silicon Psyche/`

## Architecture Philosophy

The Agentic Framework embodies a shift from reactive to **proactive security** by:
- Detecting pre-cognitive vulnerability states before exploitation
- Automating context-aware interventions
- Learning from organizational behavior patterns
- Maintaining strict privacy through on-premise deployment

## Technical Requirements

- Compatible with CPF SML implementation (see `/AI/` root documentation)
- Requires integration with organizational data sources
- On-premise deployment for privacy compliance
- Optional: SIEM/SOAR platform integration

## Use Cases

### 🎯 Real-Time Risk Mitigation
- Detect temporal vulnerabilities (late-night activity patterns)
- Identify authority compliance risks in communications
- Flag cognitive load indicators before critical decisions

### 📊 Security Posture Analytics
- Track organizational vulnerability trends
- Correlate psychological risks with security incidents
- Generate evidence-based training recommendations

### 🔬 Research & Development
- Validate CPF predictions against real-world outcomes
- Test new vulnerability detection models
- Explore LLM security implications
