# CPF Preprint Archive

This directory contains preprint versions and working drafts of **Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF)** academic papers and technical documents.

## Overview

Preprints are preliminary versions of research papers and technical documentation that are made available before formal peer review or final publication. This archive serves as a comprehensive collection of CPF's evolving academic and technical literature.

## What Are Preprints?

Preprints are:
- **Early versions** of research papers shared for feedback and collaboration
- **Working drafts** that may be updated based on peer review
- **Reference materials** for researchers and practitioners
- **Historical records** of framework development

This collection includes both LaTeX source files (`.tex`) and compiled PDF documents (`.pdf`).
