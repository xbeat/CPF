# CPF Foundation Documentation - English

Welcome to the English language foundation documentation for the **Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF)**.

## About This Collection

This directory contains comprehensive academic and technical documentation that establishes the theoretical and empirical foundations of CPF. The framework represents a fundamental shift in cybersecurity thinking by addressing pre-cognitive and unconscious psychological processes that influence security-relevant behaviors.

## Key Concepts

### The 10 Domains of Psychological Vulnerability

The CPF identifies 10 core domains of pre-cognitive vulnerability:

1. **Authority & Obedience**: Unconscious compliance with hierarchical structures
2. **Temporal Factors**: Time-pressure and urgency exploitation
3. **Social Influence**: Peer pressure, reciprocity, and social proof
4. **Affect & Emotion**: Emotional states affecting decision-making
5. **Cognitive Load**: Information overload and attention management
6. **Group Dynamics**: Collective behavior and organizational psychology
7. **Stress Response**: Fight-flight-freeze-fawn responses
8. **Unconscious Process**: Defense mechanisms and unconscious patterns
9. **AI Interaction**: Human-AI psychological dynamics
10. **Systemic Complexity**: Emergence and cascade effects

Each domain contains 10 specific indicators (100 total), providing granular assessment capability.
