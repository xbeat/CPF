# Foundation Documentation

This directory contains the foundational academic and technical documentation for the **Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF)**.

## Overview

The CPF represents a paradigm shift in cybersecurity by addressing the pre-cognitive and unconscious psychological processes that drive security-relevant behaviors. Rather than relying solely on awareness training, CPF provides a comprehensive model for predicting and preventing security failures before they occur by integrating psychoanalytic theory with cognitive psychology.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- **Academic Papers**: Peer-reviewed research papers and technical reports on CPF theory and validation
- **White Papers**: Technical documentation for practitioners and decision-makers
- **Implementation Guides**: Practical guidance for deploying CPF in organizational contexts
- **Validation Studies**: Industrial validation research and retrospective analyses
- **Integration Frameworks**: Documentation on integrating CPF with existing standards (NIST, OWASP)
- **Vision Documents**: Future directions and strategic perspectives on CPF

## Key Areas Covered

1. **Pre-Cognitive Vulnerability Assessment**: Understanding decision-making processes that occur before conscious awareness
2. **Organizational Unconscious Dynamics**: Group-level psychological processes affecting security
3. **Behavioral Vulnerability Taxonomy**: Comprehensive classification of 100+ psychological indicators
4. **AI-Specific Psychological Vulnerabilities**: Addressing human-AI interaction risks
