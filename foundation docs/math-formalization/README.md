# CPF Mathematical Formalization

This directory contains mathematical formalizations of the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework.

## Purpose

To provide rigorous mathematical models for CPF concepts, enabling:
- Quantitative vulnerability assessment
- Predictive modeling
- Integration with automated security systems
- Empirical validation

## Structure

- `en-US/` - English mathematical formalization documents
- `it-IT/` - Italian translations of mathematical formalizations

## Contents

Mathematical models for:
- Vulnerability scoring systems
- Convergence index calculations
- Risk aggregation functions
- Privacy-preserving assessment algorithms
- Statistical validation frameworks

## Format

Documents are in LaTeX format with extensive use of mathematical notation and formal definitions.
