# CPF Educational Framework - English

Welcome to the educational documentation for the **Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF)**.

## About This Collection

This directory contains the CPF Educational Framework, a structured curriculum designed to introduce, develop, and specialize learners across the entire spectrum of psychological cybersecurity literacy. Unlike traditional security awareness programs that assume rational actors modifiable through information transfer, this educational approach recognizes that security decisions occur substantially below conscious awareness and that effective education must engage pre-cognitive processes, group dynamics, and the complex interplay between human and artificial intelligence.

## The CPF Educational Framework

The educational framework comprises four universal modules that form an invariant conceptual skeleton, modulated through four developmental levels:

### Four Universal Modules

1. **"You Don't Decide"** - Pre-cognitive processes and unconscious decision-making
2. **"How They Get You"** - Psychological exploitation techniques and vulnerabilities
3. **"The Group Thinks For You"** - Group dynamics and organizational psychology
4. **"You and the Machines"** - Human-AI interaction and psychological dynamics

### Four Developmental Levels

- **Foundation Level** - Basic psychological literacy for general audience
- **Intermediate Level** - Deeper understanding for security practitioners
- **Advanced Level** - Specialized knowledge for security professionals
- **Specialist Level** - Expert-level mastery for researchers and architects

## Educational Philosophy

This curriculum rejects the fundamental assumptions of traditional security awareness:

- **Beyond Rational Actor Models**: Security decisions happen 300-500ms before conscious awareness
- **Pre-Cognitive Focus**: Targeting automatic processes that dominate deliberate ones
- **Group Dynamics Integration**: Collective behavior emerges from unconscious basic assumptions
- **Empirical Grounding**: Based on neuroscience, behavioral economics, and psychoanalytic theory

## Progressive Learning Path

The curriculum positions CPF foundational papers as progressive waypoints:

1. **CPF Taxonomy** - Complete reference map of psychological vulnerabilities
2. **Dense Implementation Companion** - Operational specification and assessment methodology
3. **Intervention Framework** - Remediation and crisis management methodology
4. **Depth Paper** - Theoretical mentor accompanying learners throughout their journey

## Target Audiences

### General Public (Foundation Level)
- Security awareness beyond compliance checkboxes
- Understanding psychological manipulation techniques
- Basic pre-cognitive literacy

### Security Practitioners (Intermediate Level)
- Operational understanding of human factors
- Assessment methodology implementation
- Integration with existing security programs

### Security Professionals (Advanced Level)

- Theoretical depth and integration

## Key Learning Objectives

By progressing through this curriculum, learners will:

1. Understand that conscious decision-making is largely illusory in security contexts
2. Recognize the 10 domains and 100 indicators of psychological vulnerability
3. Assess pre-cognitive processes in themselves and their organizations
4. Implement evidence-based interventions for psychological vulnerabilities
5. Navigate human-AI interaction dynamics with psychological awareness
6. Manage crisis events through psychological frameworks

## Integration with Core Documentation

This educational material is designed to work alongside the core CPF documentation found in `foundation docs/core/`:

- Reference the **Taxonomy** for complete vulnerability mappings
- Use the **Implementation Companion** for practical assessment
- Apply the **Intervention Framework** for remediation strategies
- Consult the **Depth Paper** for theoretical foundations

## For Educators

This curriculum enables both large-scale literacy initiatives and specialized professional development while maintaining consistency with the underlying scientific framework. It can be:

- Adapted for corporate training programs
- Integrated into academic courses
- Used for certification programs
- Deployed in awareness campaigns
