Analysis of psychological vulnerabilities in the context of agentic AI systems.

## Overview

As AI systems become more autonomous and agentic, new psychological vulnerabilities emerge in how humans interact with, trust, and depend on these systems.

## CPF Categories Analyzed

Primary focus on:
- [9.x] AI-Specific Bias Vulnerabilities
- [1.x] Authority-Based Vulnerabilities (AI authority transfer)
- [4.x] Affective Vulnerabilities (emotional attachment to AI)
- [8.x] Unconscious Process Vulnerabilities (anthropomorphization)

## Key Findings

Documentation of how agentic AI systems create novel attack surfaces through psychological manipulation and exploitation of human cognitive biases.
