> **Ongoing threat intelligence documenting emerging psychological vulnerabilities in cybersecurity contexts**

The CPF Intelligence Bulletin series provides systematic analysis of novel attack patterns that exploit human-AI interaction dynamics. Each bulletin maps documented threats to the [Cybersecurity Psychology Framework](https://cpf3.org/) indicators, validates detection methodologies, and provides actionable mitigation strategies.

## üìã About CPF Intelligence Bulletins

### Purpose

CPF bulletins serve three critical functions:

1. **Framework Validation** - Demonstrate that CPF indicators remain robust against emerging threats
2. **Threat Intelligence** - Document novel psychological attack patterns as they emerge
3. **Practical Guidance** - Provide detection algorithms and mitigation strategies for operational deployment

### Scope

Bulletins focus specifically on **psychological vulnerabilities** in cybersecurity contexts:

- ‚úÖ Human-AI interaction patterns enabling security failures
- ‚úÖ Cognitive biases exploited by attackers
- ‚úÖ Group dynamics creating organizational blind spots
- ‚úÖ Pre-cognitive processes bypassing security awareness
- ‚ùå Pure technical vulnerabilities (covered by OWASP, CVE, etc.)
- ‚ùå Standard malware/exploit analysis (covered by threat intel feeds)

### Methodology

Each bulletin follows rigorous standards:

**Evidence Requirements:**

- Peer-reviewed research papers
- Industry threat intelligence reports
- Documented security incidents
- Empirical validation studies

**Pattern Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Documented** - Published evidence from credible sources
2. **Mappable** - Clear correspondence to CPF indicators
3. **Observable** - Detectable using CPF Field Kit methodologies
4. **Impactful** - Demonstrated or plausible security implications

## üìö Published Bulletins

### [CPB-2025-001: Q3/Q4 2025 AI Psychological Threat Landscape](https://claude.ai/chat/CPB-2025-001/)

**Published:** October 15, 2025
 **Focus:** Emerging Human-LLM Interaction Vulnerabilities

**Key Findings:**

- **Reasoning Theater Bias (RTB)** - Advanced reasoning models (o1, DeepSeek-R1) paradoxically more vulnerable to fake reasoning manipulation (300%+ attack success increase)
- **Differential Automation Bias** - LLM adoption in SOCs creates uneven performance: high-resilience analysts improve while low-resilience analysts decline
- **LLM-Assisted Social Engineering** - First documented case (Microsoft, Aug 28, 2025) of attackers weaponizing LLMs for sophisticated phishing obfuscation
- **Chain-of-Thought Exposure** - Transparent reasoning in models enables novel prompt injection with higher data exfiltration success rates

**CPF Categories:** Primarily [9.x] AI-Specific Bias Vulnerabilities, with convergence across [1.x] Authority, [5.x] Cognitive Overload, [7.x] Stress Response
