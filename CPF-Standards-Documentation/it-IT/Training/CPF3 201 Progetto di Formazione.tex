\textbf{Learning Objectives:} Implement differential privacy with epsilon 0.1; maintain minimum aggregation units throughout assessment; apply temporal delay mechanisms; anonymize data appropriately; secure data handling and storage; conduct privacy audits.

\textbf{Key Concepts:} Differential privacy, epsilon parameter, noise injection, aggregation units, temporal delay, anonymization, encryption, secure destruction.

\subsubsection{Content Outline}

\textbf{1. Differential Privacy Implementation (120 min):} Differential privacy concept review (mathematical privacy guarantee), Epsilon parameter explained (privacy budget, epsilon 0.1 = strong privacy), Noise injection mechanisms (Laplace, Gaussian), When to apply noise (aggregated scores, statistical summaries, never raw individual data), Calculating noise amount (based on epsilon, data sensitivity, query function), Practical implementation (tools, libraries, manual calculation), Privacy-utility tradeoff (lower epsilon = more privacy but less accuracy, 0.1 balances well), Verification methods (check outputs satisfy epsilon-DP), Common errors (noise too little, applied to wrong data, epsilon too high).

\textbf{2. Minimum Aggregation Units (60 min):} 10-individual requirement rationale (prevents identification even with background knowledge), Calculating aggregation units (by department, role, location, ensuring each $\ge$10), Handling edge cases (small departments: combine with similar, exclude if can't aggregate, document decisions), Dynamic aggregation (adjusting units as data collected, ensuring ongoing compliance), Verification throughout assessment (periodic checks units maintained), Reporting aggregation (clearly state unit definitions, sample sizes), What to do when aggregation not possible (report limitation, suggest future assessment with larger scope).

\textbf{3. Temporal Delay Mechanisms (45 min):} 72-hour minimum delay rationale (prevents real-time surveillance, allows anonymization review), Implementation workflows (data collection → cleaning → 72-hour hold → analysis → reporting), Exceptions (are there any? No - delay mandatory), Communicating delays to stakeholders (set expectations upfront, explain privacy rationale), Delay verification (timestamp logs, audit trails), Longer delays when appropriate (higher sensitivity data, additional review needed).

\textbf{4. Data Anonymization Techniques (60 min):} Anonymization vs pseudonymization (CPF requires anonymization, no linkage back to individuals), Removing direct identifiers (names, employee IDs, email addresses, photos), Removing indirect identifiers (unique combinations of attributes), k-anonymity concepts (groups of k indistinguishable individuals, k $\ge$ 10 for CPF), Data suppression (removing unique values), Data generalization (age ranges instead of exact age, department instead of specific role), Anonymization validation (attempt re-identification, red team privacy), Secure handling during anonymization.

\textbf{5. Secure Data Handling and Destruction (45 min):} Encryption requirements (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit), Access controls (role-based, least privilege, multi-factor authentication), Audit logging (all data access logged, logs reviewed regularly), Secure storage (encrypted databases, backup encryption, physical security for printed materials), Data retention limits (5 years maximum, earlier destruction if appropriate), Secure destruction procedures (crypto-shredding for encrypted data, DOD 5220.22-M for physical media, certificate of destruction), Breach response planning (what if privacy compromised, notification procedures).

\subsection{Appendix E: Inter-Rater Reliability Standards}

\textbf{CPF-201 Reliability Requisiti:}

\textbf{Definition:} Inter-rater reliability measures consistency between different assessors scoring same evidence.

\textbf{Calculation Method:} Cohen's Kappa coefficient
\begin{itemize}
\item Formula: $\kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}$ where $p_o$ = observed agreement, $p_e$ = expected agreement by chance
\item Range: -1 to +1, higher = better reliability
\item Interpretation: < 0.20 poor, 0.21-0.40 fair, 0.41-0.60 moderate, 0.61-0.80 substantial, 0.81-1.00 almost perfect
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CPF Standards:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum acceptable: Kappa > 0.70 (substantial agreement)
\item Target: Kappa > 0.80 (almost perfect agreement)
\item Applied to: Indicator-level scores (Green/Yellow/Red), at least 20 indicators tested
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calibration Process:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple raters (minimum 3) independently score same evidence
\item Calculate Kappa between all rater pairs
\item If Kappa < 0.70: Discuss discrepancies, identify sources of disagreement
\item Review Field Kit scoring criteria together
\item Re-score independently
\item Recalculate Kappa, verify > 0.70
\item Document calibration process and final Kappa
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common Sources of Disagreement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Misinterpretation of Field Kit criteria (solution: review criteria definition)
\item Different evidence weighting (solution: discuss quality hierarchy)
\item Domain knowledge gaps (solution: additional training)
\item Bias (leniency, severity, halo - solution: awareness and calibration)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Documentation Requisiti:}
Professional assessments must document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of raters involved
\item Indicators tested for reliability
\item Kappa coefficient calculated
\item Calibration process if Kappa initially < 0.70
\item Final reliability achieved
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Certification Examination:} CPF-201 practical exam includes reliability testing. Candidate scores compared to expert panel scores, must achieve Kappa > 0.70 on at least 70/100 indicators to demonstrate competence.

\subsection{Appendix F: Privacy Calculation Examples}

\textbf{Differential Privacy Example:}

\textbf{Scenario:} Calculating mean score for Domain [1.x] Authority across 50-person department.

\textbf{Step 1:} Calculate true mean: Sum of 50 individual category scores: 450, True mean: 450 / 50 = 9.0

\textbf{Step 2:} Determine sensitivity: Sensitivity = maximum possible change from adding/removing one individual, Category score range: 0-20, Sensitivity = 20 / 50 = 0.4

\textbf{Step 3:} Calculate noise scale: Laplace mechanism: Scale = Sensitivity / epsilon, Scale = 0.4 / 0.1 = 4.0

\textbf{Step 4:} Generate and add noise: Sample from Laplace(0, 4.0): e.g., noise = +1.2, Noisy mean: 9.0 + 1.2 = 10.2

\textbf{Step 5:} Report noisy mean: "Domain [1.x] Authority mean score: 10.2" (This satisfies epsilon-differential privacy with epsilon = 0.1)

\textbf{Aggregation Unit Example:}

\textbf{Scenario:} 200-person organization, 8 departments of varying sizes.

\textbf{Department Sizes:} Executive: 5 (too small), Sales: 30 $\checkmark$, Marketing: 15 $\checkmark$, Engineering: 60 $\checkmark$, Operations: 40 $\checkmark$, Finance: 12 $\checkmark$, HR: 8 (too small), IT: 30 $\checkmark$

\textbf{Aggregation Strategy:} Option 1: Combine Executive + HR = 13 $\checkmark$ (administrative functions), Option 2: Exclude Executive and HR, focus on 6 departments $\ge$10, Option 3: Use role-based aggregation instead (Managers, Individual Contributors across all departments)

\textbf{Selected Approach:} Option 1 (combine small departments by function), results in 7 aggregation units all $\ge$10.

\textbf{Documentation:} "Assessment used department-based aggregation units. Executive and HR combined due to small sizes (total n=13). All aggregation units maintained minimum 10 individuals."
