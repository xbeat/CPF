\begin{abstract}
This document defines the certification scheme for the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF), including requirements for individual certifications (CPF Assessor, CPF Practitioner, CPF Auditor) and organizational certifications (CPF Compliance Levels). The scheme is designed in accordance with ISO/IEC 17065:2012 requirements for certification bodies operating product, process, and service certification systems. This certification scheme enables systematic validation of competence in psychological vulnerability assessment and organizational capability in implementing CPF-based security controls. The framework addresses the critical gap between technical security controls and human factors, providing standardized pathways for professionals and organizations to demonstrate mastery of pre-cognitive vulnerability management.

\section{Introduzione}

\subsection{Purpose and Scope}

The CPF Schema di Certificazione establishes comprehensive requirements for certifying individuals and organizations in the systematic assessment and mitigation of psychological vulnerabilities within cybersecurity contexts. This scheme addresses the fundamental gap in current cybersecurity certification programs, which focus predominantly on technical competencies while neglecting the psychological dimensions that contribute to 82-85\% of security incidents.

The scope of this certification scheme includes:

\textbf{Individual Certifications:}
\begin{itemize}
\item CPF Assessor Certification: Validates competence in conducting systematic psychological vulnerability assessments using the CPF methodology
\item CPF Practitioner Certification: Confirms practical application of CPF principles in organizational settings
\item CPF Auditor Certification: Certifies capability to audit CPF implementation and compliance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Organizational Certifications:}
\begin{itemize}
\item CPF Compliance Level 1-4: Validates organizational maturity in psychological vulnerability management across four progressive levels
\end{itemize}

This scheme does not replace existing cybersecurity certifications (CISSP, CISM, CEH, etc.) but complements them by addressing the psychological dimensions absent from technical certification programs.

\subsection{Certification Benefits}

CPF certification provides measurable value to individuals, organizations, and the broader cybersecurity community:

\textbf{For Individuals:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Differentiation in competitive cybersecurity job market
\item Recognition of interdisciplinary expertise bridging psychology and security

\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Organizations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced human-factor security incidents through systematic psychological vulnerability management
\item Enhanced security posture addressing the 82-85\% of breaches with human components
\item Competitive advantage demonstrating commitment to comprehensive security

\subsection{Relationship to ISO/IEC 17065}

This certification scheme is designed to be operated by certification bodies conforming to ISO/IEC 17065:2012, which specifies requirements for bodies certifying products, processes, and services. CPF certification constitutes process and service certification under ISO/IEC 17065 definitions.

Key ISO/IEC 17065 principles applied in this scheme:

\textbf{Impartiality:} Certification bodies must maintain independence from training providers, consultancies, and certified entities. Conflicts of interest are systematically identified and managed.

\textbf{Competence:} Certification body personnel must demonstrate competence in both cybersecurity and psychology domains, validated through education, training, and experience requirements.

\textbf{Consistency:} Certification decisions follow standardized evaluation criteria ensuring comparable outcomes across different assessors, organizations, and time periods.

\textbf{Confidentiality:} Assessment data, particularly psychological vulnerability information, receives heightened confidentiality protection beyond standard ISO/IEC 17065 requirements.

\textbf{Responsiveness to Complaints:} Certification bodies implement robust complaint investigation and resolution procedures with appeal mechanisms for certification decisions.

Certification bodies operating this scheme must maintain ISO/IEC 17065 accreditation through nationally recognized accreditation bodies. This ensures international recognition and mutual acceptance of CPF certifications across jurisdictions.
