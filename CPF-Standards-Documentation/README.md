> *Addressing the 85% of cybersecurity breaches caused by human factors through systematic psychological vulnerability management.*

------

## 📚 What is CPF?

The **Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF)** is the first systematic integration of psychoanalytic theory, cognitive psychology, and cybersecurity practice. Unlike traditional security awareness approaches that focus on conscious decision-making, CPF identifies and manages **pre-cognitive vulnerabilities** that operate below conscious awareness.

### Key Innovation

- **100 behavioral indicators** across 10 psychological domains
- **Privacy-preserving assessment** (no individual profiling)
- **Predictive capability** (identify vulnerabilities before exploitation)
- **Quantitative scoring** (0-100 scale, ternary indicator assessment)
- **Maturity model** (6 levels from Unaware to Optimizing)

### Theoretical Foundation

Built on validated research from:

- **Milgram (1974)** - Authority-based vulnerabilities
- **Bion (1961)** - Group dynamics
- **Klein (1946)** - Object relations theory
- **Kahneman (2011)** - Cognitive biases
- **Cialdini (2007)** - Social influence
- **Jung (1969)** - Unconscious processes
